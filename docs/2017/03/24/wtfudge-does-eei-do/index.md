Some of the other resources mentioned in the presentation include

- [Building planes in the sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7XW-mewUm8) used as not so good metaphor for how EEI will operate - a heavy reliance on learning by doing.
- [USQ teaching space guide](https://www.joomag.com/magazine/teaching-space-user-guide-introduction/0430227001460945544) - produced by a USQ project to help staff using new teaching spaces.
- [TPACK framework](http://tpack.org).
- [S1, 2017 L&T orientation](http://bit.ly/2017orient) - resource page for the S1, 2017 teaching orientation for new academics. The first big official Professional Learning Opportunity (PLO) organised by EEI.
- [Teaching @ Sydney](http://sydney.edu.au/education-portfolio/ei/teaching@sydney/) - an interesting approach to sharing resources and insights around learning and teaching.
- [Smallest Federated Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallest_Federated_Wiki) - a better (than a Wordpress blog) example of a technology foundation on which to base the sharing of resources around learning and teaching
