What follows are the resources associated with a workshop being run at the University of Southern Queensland. As the title suggests, the aim is to get USQ folk started using [the Moodle Activity Viewer](https://damos.world/2013/08/30/the-moodle-activity-viewer-mav-heatmaps-of-student-activity/) to explore usage of Moodle activities and resources, and to briefly introduce the idea of digital renovation.

Apart from the presentation slides and references below, other related resources include:

- Instructions for [installing the MAV](http://tiny.cc/installmav) for USQ staff.
    
    _Note:_ can only be accessed when on a USQ campus network (or the USQ VPN).
    
- Additional details [on other USQ digital reno tools](http://tiny.cc/usqreno)
