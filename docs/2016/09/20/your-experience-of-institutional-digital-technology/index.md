What is your experience of the digital technologies provided by the organisations for which you work?

If you'd like to share, please complete the poll below, more detail below.

\[polldaddy poll="9526698"\]

### About the poll

The poll is a semi-serious attempt to gather the perceptions of how people perceive organisational digital technologies. The idea (and the text from the two poll options) comes from [this conference paper.](/blog2/2016/02/02/what-if-our-digital-technologies-were-protean-implications-for-computational-thinking-learning-and-teaching/) The presentation will be on Friday 30th September with additional presentation resources coming to this blog soon.
