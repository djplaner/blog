        Interesting research questions at the end. The idea that current push for coding
        in schools will fail is the elephant in the room. At least in high school it is
        often an elective, but I''ve seen some dodgy whole-school integration of coding
        in primary and wonder if it would best serve our kids left as electives taught
        by teachers with excellent IT skills &amp; knowledge. I actually think giving
        students the space and time to make &amp; be creative is a better focus and likely
        has more potential in developing youth who are innovative. I wish I ran a MakerSpace
        at school but it''s surprising how rigid some curriculum programmes are and how
        difficult it is to work around it; for now I run ad hoc one lesson MakerSpace
        inspired classes between units of work.
    
    
        I agree that a major problem with Teacher &amp; Ed leadership right now is this
        blind-follow of media/govt. #codingcounts hype.  Their ignorance may very well
        result in turning kids off to learning IT altogether. Previous to this "coding
        for every child" mantra there was the eSafety bandwagon which resulted in scare
        tactics and massive blocking of Internet sites at schools. I talk to senior Year
        11 &amp; 12 students often who think their avoidance of all social media and online
        collaboration sites is good and then I am the first teacher to tell them that
        all of these sites are commonly used in Business organisations today; ridiculous!
        How will these young adults manage online collaboration at work?  Then there are
        also many students who use social media etc successfully outside of school and
        then routinely told at school that creating a PowerPoint presentation is the height
        of their integrated ICT learning at school.  What a mess!'

      content: 'Thinking more about barriers to learning how to program.  Have seen mention
        as having something useful to do with programming mentioned.  Harks back to my
        days teaching intro programming.  Converting temperature between metric and imperial
        wasn''t all that exciting.
    
    
        What reasons might a primary school teacher have to use programming in their everyday
        life?  Especially given all the tech they use is not protean?

## Abstract

Digital technology is increasingly a pervasive presence in contemporary society. The knowledge and skills required to utilise digital technologies are increasingly seen as necessary for both individuals and organisations, if they wish to become successful participants in and contributors to society. For the individuals and organisations involved in education there is a growing expectation that they are not only required to help learners develop the necessary digital technology knowledge and skills, but that they have the knowledge and skills to effectively use digital technology to fulfill that requirement. Recent history suggests that many individuals and institutions involved in education are struggling to fulfill this expectation (Bigum, 2012; Johnson, Adams Becker, Estrada, & Freeman, 2015; Masters, 2016; Mcleod & Carabott, 2016; OECD, 2015; Willingham, 2016).

[![ignorance-of-faculty by Wright Reading, on Flickr](images/1243239706_f483ca6ce5_m.jpg "ignorance-of-faculty by Wright Reading, on Flickr")](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rightreading/1243239706/) [ignorance-of-faculty](https://www.flickr.com/photos/rightreading/1243239706/) ([CC BY-NC 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/)) by [Wright Reading](https://www.flickr.com/people/rightreading/) [](http://www.imagecodr.org/)

There are numerous factors that contribute toward these on-going struggles. However, this talk will propose that ignorance of and the subsequent failure to harness the true nature of digital technology is a significant, under-examined, and in some cases deemed an unimportant factor (Kirschner, 2015). Drawing on a range of literature (Kay, 1984; Mishra & Koehler, 2006; Papert, 1993; Yoo, Boland, Lyytinen, & Majchrzak, 2012; Yoo, Henfridsson, & Lyytinen, 2010) this talk will develop a model for understanding the fundamental properties and unique affordances of digital technology. The talk will illustrate how this model can be used to identify and understand significant shortcomings with existing practice and research at all levels of education. Lastly, the talk will use the model to map out potentially, fruitful areas of future research around questions such as:

- Why will growing up using digital technology everyday never be sufficient to make you a digital native?
- Why might [88.5% of teachers and 74% of students in Auburn,](http://www.sunjournal.com/news/lewiston-auburn/2016/05/19/state-offering-schools-ipad-trade/1927446) Maine prefer laptops over iPads, and what might that say about the value of tablets as computing devices?
- Why is the Moodle assignment activity so hard to use in my course and why does the provided documentation not help?
- What's next after the Learning Management System?
- Why is the current push to embed the teaching of coding in primary schools likely to fail and what might be done about it?
- How might an educational institution leverage the fundamental properties and unique affordances of digital technology to be "[a leader in physical and digital higher education learning experiences geared to a diverse student constituency](http://www.usq.edu.au/about-usq/about-us/plans-reports/strategic-plan)"?
