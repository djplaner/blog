Last year I gave a [a couple of presentations](/blog2/2009/10/05/lectures-and-the-lms-alternatives-and-experiments/) titled "Alternatives for the institutional implementation of e-learning". In those presentations I essentially argued that what passes for current practice of e-learning in universities - what I now call "industrial e-learning" - suffers from a significant mismatch which, I believe, contributes to most of its limitations. My argument is that the nature of the product (the LMS) and the process (teleological) adopted in industrial e-learning to be completely unsuited to the nature of the people involved in e-learning, the nature of learning and teaching and the nature of universities and the context in which they operate.

Anyone who has been following this blog for some time will recognise that sentiment in any number of posts. But this one is a little different.

This thinking has formed the basis for and arisen out of my PhD thesis which I'm trying to rapidly finish. Over the last couple of weeks I've been cutting down the enormous Chapter 2 (literature review) that I wrote last year into something approaching an acceptable size. The basis for this cutting has become the argument used in those presentations.

It is with some relief that I release into the world [Chapter 2](http://davidtjones.files.wordpress.com/2010/03/chapter_2_version1a.pdf) of my thesis. It's an attempt to make the above argument in a formal way and set up the space for my contribution in the form of an [information systems design theory](http://dl.acs.org.au/index.php/ajis/article/view/439) (i.e. a better way) for e-learning.

The current state of this draft is that it basically fits together. I'm walking away from it for a couple of weeks to get some head space, before I come back to it and polish it up. Any and all feedback is welcome.
