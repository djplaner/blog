Just floating another idea for a research project around the [Indicators project](http://indicatorsproject.wordpress.com/).

### The spark

In [reflecting back](/blog2/2010/03/17/the-story-of-bim-development-of-bam/) on the origins of BIM, I generated the following stats about late enrollments

> 73% of the students in this offering enrolled in the course after term had started. In fact, 21% of the students were enrolled on the last day of week 2 of term. Supposedly the last day students could enroll. A further 9% of students were enrolled after week 2.

This was in 2005. I've since had confirmation that the problem continues to exist from another staff member. Along with the suggestion that in one course, all of the students who enrolled late, failed the course. **Correction:** I've just been corrected. what actually happened was that "all of the students who failed had enrolled late". i.e. enrolling late - in this course - is a good predictor that you will fail the course.

I've just checked the 2010 offering of the 2005 course. 48.5% of students enrolled after the term had started. On the positive side, none of them have enrolled late. For another course I'm interested in this term, the figure was 52%

### Student signatures

One of the "patterns" we have talked about is the idea of developing a "student signature" of LMS usage. i.e. a pictorial (or perhaps mathematical) way to represent how an individual student uses the LMS. The idea is that there might be differences in how they use the LMS. Something that might be used as a predictor. i.e. if you see pattern X in week 4 for a student, there might be a strong likelihood that they will do Y.

Amazing the serendipity in the blogosphere. The day I posted this, but after I'd posted it, I see [David Wiley's post](http://opencontent.org/blog/archives/1286) about some of the work they are doing. The waterfall visualisation he shares could form the basis for one type of student signature, and could be interesting in looking for patterns around the topic of late enrolling students. However, as Mark Smithers asks in a comment, defining how you calculate the amount of time a student spends on assessable activities might be difficult. Initially, we might have to rely on site visits as a proxy (though I'm getting uncomfortable with this use of proxies).

### What might be done

It would be interesting to:

- See if late enrolling students have a different signature.
- Whether they are more likely to achieve a certain outcome.
- Find out what they are feeling when the start a course late.
- Why they are starting a course late.
- If this significant late enrollment can't be stopped, what strategies can be adopted to help the students get going.
