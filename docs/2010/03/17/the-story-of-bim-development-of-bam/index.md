This is the second episode in the continuing story of BIM. This episode picks up the story late in the first half of 2006. The [initial foray](/blog/2010/03/15/the-story-of-bim-origins-blogs-and-minute-papers/) into using individual student blogs to encourage reflection and make student learning more visible was bumbling along. It was now time to think about what I'd be teaching the following term.

### Introducing COIS20025, Systems Development Overview

Since 1990 I had been teaching within the information technology program at [CQU](http://www.cqu.edu.au/). For various reasons I was no longer happy teaching within that program, one of the reasons is that through my work in e-learning I'd realised that there was a lot more to technology systems, than technology. You can make a beautiful bit of technology, but if it involves change on the part of the users, they won't use it they way you intended (if at all). As a result, from the second half of 2006 I was moving into the information systems program. Theoretically, information systems is interested in the combination of software and otherware (i.e. the people, organisations etc.).

My first teaching task within the information systems program was the course [COIS20025, Systems Development Overview](http://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/Courses/2006/T2/COIS20025/). It was a Masters level course looking intended to give an overview of how information systems were developed (somewhat surprisingly - though not really - it tended to focus on the technology and methods and very little on the otherware). Traditionally the course was taught across multiple campuses by 10+ teaching staff and 200+ students. I would be the course coordinator responsible for managing all this and in addition teaching the students at the Rockhampton campus and those studying by distance education.

Check what early emails I have about this course. And my move to the information systems school. Give the background here on the course.

### Thinking about COIS20025

By early 2006 I was starting to look at and think about what I might have to do with COIS20025. History showed that there were some concerns about the course. For example, a previous coordinator had received a "please explain" about why there was only 1 student getting a HD from 384. The response from the coordinator explained this drawing on reasons that were widely recognised by those at the coal face. i.e. that the majority of the students came from a non-English speaking background (NESB), most had little familiarity with technology, COIS20025 was taken in the first term they were in Australia getting to grips with a foreign culture and these problems were made worse by the fact that 73% of the students in this offering enrolled in the course after term had started. In fact, 21% of the students were enrolled on the last day of week 2 of term. Supposedly the last day students could enroll. A further 9% of students were enrolled after week 2.

Some comments from the previous coordinator

> there is nothing in the course itself that makes me believe that it is too difficult for Post-Graduate students to manage...I can not see what else can be done to improve the results in COIS20024 and COIS20025 with the exception of capping the number of students we enrol and haivng a more stringent entry requirement for English Language Skills.

It could also be observed that the methods used in the course differed little from traditional methods from the glory (and probably mythical) days of higher education of motivated students.

This particular tension between teaching staff and the management of teaching staff is not new or specific to this course. My first experience of it was the late 1990s and have seen it in numerous courses. To this day I see no evidence of significant and successful changes to address this problem.

> **CHALLENGE #6:** The increasing complexity of the teaching context within some Australian universities has resulted some significant tension and differences of opinion between management and teaching staff. Many of these remain unresolved.

While the changing nature of the students and the context suggests a need to change toward more innovative methods that engage the students, that address the limited performance of students. Tutty et al (2008) capture the more common approach

> The solution to the high failure rate was to change the assessment to satisfy the institutional requirements of satisfied students and reasonable pass rates rather than explore an alternative learning and teaching approach â€“ an effective solution in the current higher education environment that encourages the academic to prioritise other areas, such as research.

> **CHALLENGE #7:** The context within universities is not favourable to exploration of innovative, alternative pedagogies.

### Reflective journals - the Word document approach

During 2005, in an attempt to encourage student reflection and hopefully encourage a higher level of learning an assignment was introduced that required students to keep a "reflective" diary. The diary was submitted at the end of term for review by staff. There were two problems observed with this approach: creative writing and plagiarism. Since the diary was not submitted until the end of term, it was felt by teaching staff that many students left the diary until a last minute exercise in creative writing. There was also problems with plagiarism. The second offering of COIS20025 in 2005 had 62 plagiarism incidents.

To address these sorts of problems students were meant to submit their diaries three times during the term to teaching staff for checking. This practice was never widely implemented due to workload and resource problems. In particular, this is a problem for teaching staff at the international campuses who are either casual staff employed for a specific number of students and a particular set of assumptions, or they are full-time staff who operate under a high workload.

> **CHALLENGE #8:** Workload pressures limit the adoption of changes in pedagogy.

### The problem

Introduce the problem with the reflective journal assignment.

Back in 2006 I had a problem. I was about to take over a post-graduate Masters course in System development. The course was taught across multiple campuses by 10+ teaching staff and taken by 200+ students. Most of the students were from a non-English speaking background. In order to encourage reflection and higher order learning, the course had one assignment that required the students to keep a reflective journal. Here's where the problem arises.

Students were told to keep the journal as a Word document and submit it at the end of the term. Consequently, most students did not work on the journal during term, leaving it to the last minute. Teaching staff did not see what was written in the journal and could not respond or comment. The course coordinator - located at a campus some distance from where the majority of the students were located - certainly couldn't see what was going on. The limited integration between what the student was doing and the marking of the journal probably contributed to significant levels of plagiarism that occurred with the assignment.

### How to make it better

Given my interest and experience with blogs, this seemed a perfect fit. In addition, at this stage this course was offered using CQU's home-grown LMS, Webfuse. The Webfuse assignment submission system was already heavily used in this course, it was part of the way things were done. In addition, I am the main designer of Webfuse and as late of 2004 was the Webfuse team lead. This mean I could see how easy it would be to add a feature to Webfuse that would allow the use of blogs in a large course to be managed in a more efficient way. This feature was to be known as Blog Aggregation Management - BAM.

**CHALLENGE #9** It was only through a unique combination of contexts that the idea for BAM was identified. Remove any one of these conditions and BAM probably would not have happened.

After 10 years of working on innovative e-learning through my own interest I was not going to develop BAM on top of the rest of my workload. Especially since there remained large uncertainty about the future of Webfuse (Webfuse eventually was repalced at CQU in 2010). In addition, at this stage my current laptop was getting on a bit. I needed a new one and university computer replacement policy would result in me getting something less than nice. I needed some money to top this up.

The previous coordinator of COIS20025 and I collaborated on a proposal to develop BAM. This was put to the faculty management and included the suggestion that I be given $2000 to develop BAM. The proposal was accepted.

> **CHALLENGE #10** The development of innovative blended learning pedagogy requires additional funding. Innovation costs initially.

The decision to support the development of BAM was, from my perspective, not a logical thing for the organisation to do. I believe it only happened because a small number of the players within faculty management at this point in time, had positive impressions of Webfuse, myself and the idea of BAM. Had this proposal been considered at another point in time, with different people in those positions, I believe the outcome would have been different.

### The initial development and use of BAM

By the 8th of May 2006 I was running a "design workshop" for BAM. An hour long presentation to university staff proposing the idea and describing prototypes of how it might work. The aim was to get the idea out there and get feedback. The [video of that presentation](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=965377384627246106#3m50s) can be viewed on Google Video. **I need to look through this and the powerpoint slides and find where I was up to with my thinking**

On the 11th of September, 2006 a follow up presentation was given to report on the lessons learned so far in the use of BAM in the course. It includes a summary of what has happened as of Week 8 of (a 12 week) term:

- 258 of 278 students have registered blogs;
- Marking of blog posts not done, mostly due to the late arrival of the marking facility within BAM.
- Staff overview of the blogs has been patch.

A significant component of the use of BAM in COIS20025 for this term was spent in designing the questions students were asked to respond to on their blogs. It wasn't just the technology. The design had moved beyond just using minute papers into some specific questions intended to make visible the students' preparation for the assignments. The aim was to enable staff to make comments before assignment submission, reduce plagiarism and attempt to increase higher-order learning.

#### Problems

For various reasons, I do not believe that these aims were achieved on a broad scale. In part, this is because the COIS20025 students were very pragmatic, the majority did what what was required to get the mark they wanted with a minimum of effort, rather engage completely with the intent.

> **CHALLENGE #11:** A significant percentage of students are very pragmatic. They don't automatically engage with the aims of innovative pedagogy.

Another significant contributor was "change management" issues. Essentially, most staff did not look at student blogs during the term. They were left until marking was done at the end of term. Two main issues created this: the late finish of the interface staff would use to mark the blogs, and workload issues for the staff. While BAM **may** have reduced the actual work required to mark student journals, the novelty and uncertainty around the system meant this was not how staff perceived the system.

> **CHALLENGE #12:** New or novel pedagogies are always perceived to require more work from participants. This is simply because of the need for participants to become familiar with the novelty. Novelty on top of an overloaded or overly pragmatic set of participants limits engagement.

#### Successes

One of the more engaged members of the teaching staff made this observation in interviews

> Students tend to fall off the wagonâ€¦the major reason why the blog was created. So that we can keep track of students working week by week rather thanâ€¦working the night before the assignment is dueâ€¦in that respect it seems to have worked well.

The blogs also appeared to confirm Du and Wagner (2005) and provide a useful predictor for learning outcomes for high and low performing students. Of the 9 high performing students in COIS20025, all 9 performed highly on their blog posts. Of the 6 students who did not register a blog (obvious by week 4 of term), 4 failed every course they studied that term and 2 failed two of the three courses they were studying.

Technically the system worked well. Students had a blog without the institution needing to provide a blog service. The management system, once in place, enable marking and tracking of student posts to occur and integrated with institutional management systems. The project was included in the ELI Guide to Blogging (Coghlan, Crawford et al. 2007) released in 2007 which indicated that the marriage of Web 2.0 applications with institutional systems was a compelling part of this project and that it promised to give institutional systems greater efficacy and agility with reduced cost.

### More details

More detail about the initial use of BAM in COIS20025 can be found in two publications. [One](/blog/publications/blog-aggregation-management-reducing-the-aggravation-of-managing-student-blogging/), written in 2006 just after completion, and [another](/blog/publications/blog-aggregation-management-reducing-the-aggravation-of-managing-student-blogging/) written in late 2008 after a period of some reflection.
