I'm currently programming up bim2, a new version [of BIM](/blog/research/bam-blog-aggregation-management/) to work with Moodle 2.0. I'm wondering whether a version of BIM for [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) might be an idea.

A while ago Leigh Blackall wondered why [BIM had to be inside an LMS](/blog/2010/04/25/inside-out-outside-in-or-both/). There were some reasons at the time. However, most no longer apply and I'm increasingly interested in moving beyond the LMS world. As a long-term Wordpress user, a Wordpress plugin might make some sense.

Such a plugin would be a small step away from BIM towards [edufeedr](/blog/2010/11/16/edufeedr-is-live-bim-for-open-blog-courses/). Both BIM and edufeedr are very similar in what they do. The main difference is the infrastructure they rely upon, BIM on Moodle and edufeedr on elgg (if I recollect correctly). Wordpress is perhaps a little more mainstream Web than elgg and Wordpress is being used by some playing with open-ish courses.

BIM as a Wordpress plugin would retain the marking/management features, but should probably pay a bit more attention to re-purposing aggregated posts. Perhaps aggregated posts could be fed into the main blog and other locations?

Wonder if there's a Wordpress plugin that already does this? Would this be a good idea?

Am aware of this [tutorial for Wordpress plugins](http://php.heaveninteractive.com/php-tutorials/wordpress-php-tutorials/create-your-first-wordpress-plugin-in-10-minutes/) via @marksmithers. Seems a good place to start.

Will have to wait until bim2 for Moodle is done.
