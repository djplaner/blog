title: Is there more to communities of practice?
type: post

[Markus](http://mathehu.wordpress.com/) and I have been talking about behaviour change and lots more for a bit. He's about to start a new job [has been speculating](http://mathehu.wordpress.com/2010/05/13/taking-moodle-into-prison-dentistry/) about what he might do and how it connects with what we've been talking about. This post is an attempt to make explicit my initial gut reaction to the idea that

> distributive leadership may not help, but communities of practice might

It's main outcomes will likely be to encourage me to read and understand more about both conceptions.

### A cynical, ill-informed view of communities of practice

My knowledge of communities practice is limited to my observations of local attempts to implement then and having purchased and skimmed one of Wegner's books on the topic. Based on the vastly ill-informed perspective my current opinion is that communities of practice suck. I've [previously outlined](/blog/2010/03/14/improving-lt-at-universities-the-emperor-has-no-clothes/#cop) two of the reasons I don't think they are working to improve L&T within universities. On reflection, my problems with CoP are the following, (most based on observations of local context, hence generalisability is somewhat limited)

- If voluntary, they attract the folk who least need them.  
    A voluntary CoP around assessment within a university is likely to attract people who are intrinsically interested in assessment. People who aren't interested won't join. I suggest that it's the folk who won't join that are more likely to be the folk who need to join.
- If compulsory, they encourage compliance or corruption.  
    Force an academic (knowledge worker? Dentist?) to do something they don't want to do and they aim to be seen to comply, but won't really participate. There's a chance participation might lead to a change of mind, but that's an if.
- They are likely to suffer all the common collaboration problems.  
    Get any group of people together and you are likely to find problems such as the [herd mentality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_mentality), [echo chamber](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_chamber_%28media%29) etc. Not to mention the problem that for some CoPs are becoming seen as yet another tool of management.
- They find it hard to change the system.  
    Most of the CoPs I have seen set up are not directly connected with the formal leadership of the institution or the formal processes/systems of the institution. Consequently, the discussions do not end up changing the institution's systems or processes. The focus becomes sharing and talking, not making changes.

Obviously most of these can be addressed in setting up the CoP. But what I'm interested in is getting the whole system/context setup in a way that encourages on-going reflection and change. And that's more than just people talking.

### Distributive leadership as different/better

At the moment, the most interesting aspect of distributive leadership for me is its foundation on [distributed cognition](http://www.learning-theories.com/distributed-cognition-dcog.html). Due to this foundation, leadership within distributive leadership is not a function of the formal leadership hierarchy within an organisation. It is also more than distributing leadership responsibility into the people within an organisation. It's about distributing leadership responsibility into the people and the systems and the processes of the organisation.

This is important, if you limit leadership to just the formal leaders or the people you are missing the point. I also think this is the bit most people don't get and one I'm still figuring out how to explain. Is this a point of departure from CoP, inclusion of systems/processes as well as people into consideration?

How about we consider what leadership is? What does it entail? Some [previous reading and thinking](/blog/2010/04/29/the-alignment-project-as-leadership/) identified two functions that are thought to be indispensable to leadership (Sourthwell and Morgan, 2009; Leithwood an Levin, 2005):

- Direction-setting; and  
    What is the direction or purpose considered valuable/appropriate?
- Influence.  
    Encouraging folk to move towards the direction, to achieve the purpose.

Let's use [Markus' problem](http://mathehu.wordpress.com/2010/05/13/taking-moodle-into-prison-dentistry/) as the example. Thinking of this from a "distributive leadership" perspective (or at least what I currently think might be such a thing) might suggest the following perspective.

The direction or purpose is to reduce the sense of isolation of the dentists within Scottish prisons. In itself, this is a pretty big assumption. What's the evidence that the dentists feel this and that it's a problem? Is the lack of funding priority indicative that this is not important?

As I'm ignorant of this evidence, but could see that it could be important, Let's assume that it is important. Why aren't the dentists already moving in this direction? Why aren't they talking more?

My interest/argument would be in finding out what is about the systems and processes within which they work that prevent them from reducing isolation and identifying the interesting ways you could reduce those barriers. The question is, if getting rid of isolation is an important direction, why aren't the systems and processes used by the dentists in their job helping them get there?

For me this isn't about setting up a community of practice, as that doesn't immediately fundamentally address the barriers in the system that is creating the isolation. Participating in a CoP might creates a reason to overcome the isolation, but it doesn't remove the barriers.

### Some examples

The following is an attempt to provide some more concrete examples of what I mean by focusing on the prison dentists case. Rather than seriously suggests specific solutions, the idea here is to give a taste for how small, diverse and widespread the changes might be.

Markus describes a system that includes under-staffing, logistic difficulties, difficulties sourcing equipment and materials, an under-funded system. From that I get a picture of dentists that are overworked by a system that is continually showing that it doesn't really value what they do.

> _Change?_ the prison hierarchy do something that (continually) illustrates to the dentists that there services are valued (e.g. all prison dentists be given the choice car park place).

Would folk in such a context have any sense of ownership or control over the work they do?

> _Change?_ Get prison hierarchy buy-in to engage in a [social network stimulation](http://www.cognitive-edge.com/method.php?mid=43) type project involving the dentists and others within the system. Perhaps focused on oral health?

Would folk in such a context have the time, motivation and technology available to talk to each other?

> _Change?_ Identify some dentistry good practice that requires collaboration and is broadly accepted. Give them all iPads (sexy technology that they can collaborate with, but also do other things) as part of a project that seeks to embed the select practice into their everday live

This is definitely echoing the alignment project (internal echo chamber?).

Another thought, do they need to communicate with other prison dentists, what about other dentists, other prison workers?
