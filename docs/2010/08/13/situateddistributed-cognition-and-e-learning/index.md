This quote summarises very nicely what I think will become a major research interest of mine in the future. i.e. how can we modify the environment - particularly, but not primarily, through information technology - within universities to encourage and enable improvements in teaching and learning?  
  
I have a feeling/belief that heavyweight/top-down approaches to improving teaching (e.g. requiring all staff to have a formal teaching qualification, or specifying minimum standards of performance) simply don't work, at least not if you closely examine the cost/benefit ratio of these approaches.  
  
Instead, I am interested in the tools and representations that can be built into the higher education teaching environment to improve situated/distributed cognition and subsequently improve teaching.  
  
Once the thesis is finished, I'm hoping to have the time to look more closely at this. Any suggestions on where to start reading?

> |   This recognition that our processing uses external representations is an important component in looking at ways to support performance. When should we provide tools, whether representational or computational, instead of trying to put all information in the head? We need a richer picture of how we perform, rather than a simplistic and ineffectual model that posits we can know everything we need.
