It's been over 4 months since my [last PhD update](/blog2/2010/04/09/phd-update-26-getting-to-first-draft-stage/), past time to get back into the discipline. A lot has happened in those 4 months, the grant talked about in the last post didn't get off the ground thanks to folk leaving positions at the potential partner institution and then because I left mine. So, the new context is that I'm currently a man of leisure, thanks to a separation payout, and increasingly focused on finally finishing the thesis.

### What I did last week

In the last week I have:

- Almost completed the evaluation section for chapter 5;  
    This involved a lot of [data munging](http://www.manning.com/cross/) and then "re-munging". Not quite complete, but very close.
- Completed a first draft of chapter 6;  
    This is the final chapter. The rough draft is intended to get the structure and content right without aiming for smooth prose. It's been sent to the thesis supervisor for some feedback.
- Completed an almost final draft of chapter 1;  
    Much of this had been done, however, some bits were left open until latter chapters had been completed. I also had to make some tweaks based on feedback. In a couple of days, I'll re-read this on paper, double check alignment with other chapters and starting shopping it around to other people to read.

### What will I do next week

Next week will be interesting. I'm traveling for 3 days, so, may not be able to achieve all of the following, but the aim will be to move towards :

- Completing the evaluation section of chapter 5;
- Completing the Lessons section of chapter 5;
- Taking some initial steps for formalising the final ISDT;
- Start sending a final draft of chapter 1 around to folk for reading.
