title: Webfuse feature adoption - 1997 through 2009
type: post
template: blog-post.html
---
The following presents details of feature adoption by courses using the Webfuse system from 1997 through 2009. It presents the data generated by the work [described in the last post](/blog2/2010/07/01/examining-feature-adoption-slightly-better-approach/).

No real analysis or propositions, mostly just the data. Analysis is next step.

### How features are grouped

To provide some level of Webfuse independence I've used the model developed by Malikowski et al (2007) and represented in the following image.

[![Reworked Malikowski model](images/3858116950_aa68b05446_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/3858116950/ "Reworked Malikowski model by David T Jones, on Flickr")

Essentially, each Webfuse feature was assigned to one of four categories:

1. Transmitting content.
2. Interactions.
3. Evaluating students.
4. Evaluating courses.

### Feature adoption

The following table shows the results. The adoption rate is shown as a percentage of Webfuse courses that used a particular feature category.

| Year | \# course sites | Transmit content | Interactions | Student eval | Course eval |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1997 | 109 | 34.9 | 1.8 | 0.9 | 9.2 |
| 1998 | 138 | 38.4 | 48.6 | 1.4 | 0.7 |
| 1999 | 189 | 46.0 | 9.0 | 2.1 | 9.5 |
| 2000 | 174 | 46.6 | 43.7 | 24.7 | 6.9 |
| 2001 | 244 | 51.6 | 32.4 | 47.1 | 28.3 |
| 2002 | 312 | 69.6 | 63.8 | 57.7 | 44.2 |
| 2003 | 302 | 69.2 | 68.5 | 93.7 | 37.7 |
| 2004 | 328 | 61.3 | 61.9 | 91.8 | 35.7 |
| 2005 | 299 | 64.2 | 69.2 | 93.6 | 39.8 |
| 2006 | 297 | 70.0 | 68.7 | 105.1 | 31.6 |
| 2007 | 251 | 68.5 | 102.0 | 168.1 | 33.1 |
| 2008 | 225 | 72.9 | 110.7 | 192.0 | 51.6 |
| 2009 | 211 | 69.2 | 105.7 | 211.4 | 42.7 |

### When is a course a Webfuse course?

The most surprising aspect of the previous table is that some of the percentages are greater than 100%. How do you get more than 100% of the Webfuse courses adopting a feature?

Due to the nature of Webfuse, its features, and the political context it is possible that a course could use a Webfuse feature without having a Webfuse course website. Webfuse was never the official institutional LMS, that honour fell upon WebCT and then Blackboard. However, a number of the features provided by Webfuse were still of use to folk using WebCT or Blackboard.

For the purpose of the above, a Webfuse course is a course that has a Webfuse course site.

### Discussion

Each of the following will show a graph of each feature category and offer some brief notes and initial propositions based on the data.

#### Transmit content

[![Adoption of content transmission features Webfuse 1997 through 2009](images/4750396063_af92f87ac1_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/4750396063/ "Adoption of content transmission features Webfuse 1997 through 2009 by David T Jones, on Flickr")

Background

- 100% of Webfuse course sites had content transmission.
- From the 2nd half of 2001 these were automatically created.
- Feature adoption above only includes where teaching academics have placed additional content onto the course site.
- Main Webfuse features in this category are: course web pages, uploading various files and using the course announcements/update features.

Observations and propositions:

- The automated and expanded default course site introduction in 2001 appears correlated with an increase in use. However, that could simply be broader acceptance of the Web.
- Even at most accepted, almost 30% of staff teaching courses did not place additional content on the course site. This could be seen as bad, 30% didn't do anything, or good, 30% could focus on other tasks.

#### Interactions

[![Adoption of interaction features Webfuse 1997 through 2009](images/4750396157_e707bf34d8_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/4750396157/ "Adoption of interaction features Webfuse 1997 through 2009 by David T Jones, on Flickr")

Background:

- Percentage adoption in 1997 through 1999 is probably higher as significant numbers of courses used Internet mailing lists. However, records of these aren't tightly integrated with Webfuse course sites.
- The 1998 archives have been found, so the table above shows 48.6% of courses having mailing lists.
- From 2000 onwards Webfuse default sites included a web-based mail archive of mailing lists.

- Features include: interactive chat rooms, web-based discussion forums, email-merge, [BAM](/blog2/research/bam-blog-aggregation-management/) and web-based archives of mailing lists.
- The push over 100% in 2007 onwards comes from a combination of more widespread use of mailing lists/discussion forums in default course sites and broader adoption of the email merge facility by non-Webfuse courses.

#### Evaluate students

[![Adoption of student evaluation features Webfuse 1997 through 2009](images/4751040284_5e87456c58_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/4751040284/ "Adoption of student evaluation features Webfuse 1997 through 2009 by David T Jones, on Flickr")

Background:

- Main traditional features are online quizzes and online assignment submission and management.
- Other non-traditional student evaluation features include an academic misconduct application, assignment extension system, informal review of grade system etc.
- About 2005 onwards some of the non-traditional features became institutional systems.

#### Evaluate courses

[![Adoption of course evaluation features Webfuse 1997 through 2009](images/4750396289_66206f7df8_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/4750396289/ "Adoption of course evaluation features Webfuse 1997 through 2009 by David T Jones, on Flickr")

Background:

- 2000 and before primary evaluation is via web-based forms with a bit of course barometer usage.
- Post 2001 course barometer becomes standard in all Webfuse courses.
- But not all courses have contributions. The percentages only include a barometer feature if someone has posted a comment to it. If measured as having a course barometer, then figure would be 100% from 2001 through 2004/5.
- Spike in usage in 2008 comes from small institutional project using barometer in non-Webfuse courses.
- Similar spike in 2002 comes from active enouragement of barometer idea.
