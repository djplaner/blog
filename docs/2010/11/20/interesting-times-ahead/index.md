As [described earlier](/blog2/2010/11/12/a-turning-point/#toward) the next couple of years probably has me becoming a high school teacher. A transition I am planning to blog about, perhaps eventually to do some research about. [This comment](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/social/Scot_Aldred/how-to-make-better-teache_b_783392_67949353.html) by [Scott Aldred](http://e-learning-engagement.blogspot.com/) suggests that this might be an interesting experience. Scott's point is that various constraints and factors arising from the nature of public education and its organisation within Australia and Queensland are such that reflective blogging is not as straight forward as you might hope. Given that I'm generally somewhat cynical/critical, this might become problematic.

It is ironic that Scott's comment is [made on an article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dean-shareski/how-to-make-better-teache_b_783392.html) by Dean Shareski arguing/stating that having teachers blog is a great way to make them better teachers. It shall be interesting if I see evidence of the constraints Scott has seen.

He should know as he's been a teacher educator at the University I'm returning to as a student. And if you look at the list of followers [on his blog](http://e-learning-engagement.blogspot.com/) you can see quite a list of current/previous students from that university. Most of which appear to be keeping blogs about their journey as student teachers. Mostly as a requirement for their studies. Interesting times.
