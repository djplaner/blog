Two weekly PhD updates in a row, will be interesting to see how long this keeps going.

### What I did last week

The [aim for this week](/blog2/2010/04/02/phd-update-25-a-return-to-discipline/) was to get chapters 2 and 3 of the thesis into first draft stage and sent to the supervisor for comment. If possible, get chapter 4 into the same stage.

2 and 3 were sent on Tuesday. Chapter 4 is about 3/4 of the way into first draft stage. Hope to have that done over the weekend.

The week has been slower than normal due to school holidays and other work.

### The aim for next week

The time factor is going to raise its ugly head. Found out today that a deadline for a grant application is now a month earlier than I thought - it's now May 4. On the downside, that means that much of the time from now until May 4 will probably be spent working on that application. On the plus side, I'll have some more free time after May 4 for the thesis.

For the next week, the plan is to:

- get chapter 4 into first draft stage;
- get a rough version of chapter 6 completed; and
- if possible, get started on chapter 5.

My ultimate goal is for submission by the end of June, or as close to that as I can get.
