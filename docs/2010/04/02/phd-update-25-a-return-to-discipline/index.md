The [last PhD update](/blog2/2009/09/11/phd-update-24-off-to-the-crocodile-form/) I posted here was in early November last year. It's time to get back into the discipline of posting these updates, especially now I'm in the downhill stretch.

The rationale/excuse for not having posted in the last 3 or 4 months has been work and Christmas. For most of November, I was traveling to or working on conference presentations. I also visited Canberra in that time to work a bit on the thesis and received feedback from my supervisor - reduce content!. December was holidays and then, the great plan to spend January on holiday, working on the thesis went pear shape. For various silly, contextual issues I spent most of January and February working on [BIM](/blog2/research/bam-blog-aggregation-management/) so folk could use it starting around March. This will hopefully bring some benefits, but it didn't help thesis completion.

### What I did last week

Early last week I had completed rough first drafts of chapters 2 (lit review) and 3 (research method). Since then, when time allows, I've been re-reading these drafts and making the slight modifications that are needed. A bit of space - it's been almost 3 weeks since I finished the draft of chapter 2 - does wonders for perspective.

I've re-read all of chapter 2 and annotated it with suggested changes. I'm almost half way through making those changes in the soft copy.

### What I'll do in the next week

The aim for the next week is to have completed first drafts of chapters 2 and 3 sent off to my supervisor.

Time willing, the plan is then to get chapter 4 into the same state. I have until April 6 to get chapters in this state and sent to my supervisor.
