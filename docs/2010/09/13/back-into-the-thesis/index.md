After a week away traveling with my sons in Western Queensland, I have to get back into the thesis. This post is essentially an attempt to capture where I'm up to and plan out what I need to do for the next week or so. As with the last update, I'll start scratching these out as I complete.

The outstanding work can essentially be broken into two parts:

1. Make modifications to existing chapters; and  
    The [last PhD update](/blog2/2010/08/22/phd-update-28-minimal-work-feedback-arrived/) has a good summary of much of this work.
2. Complete the last chapter.  
    Chapter 5 is the last chapter not yet in first draft stage, and it's not far from it with only two sections not really there yet. So, the focus has to be on finalising those: the ISDT and Evaluation.

#### The ISDT

This is the major product of the thesis. Much of it is written, what's remaining to doincludes:

- Clean up the intro section to use the summary table.
- Develop a section outlining that the ISDT is more a guide than a hard blue print - what other literature is there on this?
- Define the purpose of constructs and double check the list in the table
- Principles of form and function
    - Get a few broader definitions of architecture, especially leaning towards the inclusive idea.
    - Explain the scaffolding idea a bit more, perhaps borrow from [this post](/blog2/2010/09/03/scaffolding-context-sensitive-conglomerations-in-e-learning-systems/).
    - Better explanation of human support as an aspect of scaffolding.
- Principles of implemenation
    - Work in a connection with learning.
- Artifact mutability
    - Work in the ideas proposed by Hovorka and Germonprez (2009) around artifact mutability.
    - Connect it with learning for academics, students and supporters.
- Justificatory knowledge
    - Expand support for scaffolding conglomerations.
    - Problems and references for best of breed.
    - MOre work on principles of implementation - including learning
    - distill some of the references and double check outstanding references.
    - Cioborra and related work around the move away from the teleological and analytical.
- Put more on BAM/BIM into the expository instantiation section.
- Link the summary table of Webfuse testing with the results of the evaluation.

#### Evaluation

- Finalise table 5.6.
- Decide on which time frame to limit evaluation to and argue why.  
    Use all of Webfuse post 2000. _Rationale_: While Webfuse did not at all times follow the ISDT, it did use aspects of it and even with just aspects showed some benefits. If all had been followed it may have been better again.
- Table 5.14
    - Calculate number of students in courses with webfuse sites
        - Fix up 1998 entries in stats::courses to put in right term and also add 3rd term. - 1997, 1999, 2000, 2001 counts.
    - Re-examine course site hits, page updates, unique authors from 2002 onwards?
- Table 5.15
    - Add standard deviation for updates per staff - based on updates from Table 5.14
    - Update accesses per enrolled student - based on data from Table 5.14
- Complete the table "usage of webfuse courses"
- Do power laws get a mention? -- NO
- % of BAM requests of overall staff requests for 2009.
- Rethink the adoption section and draw on summaries of previous sections and also comparisons with similar section from chapter 4. Also incorporate work from the TAM papers.
- Modify Figure 5.15 so that it uses a year where data is not missing.

#### Misc to dos

In working on the above I'll almost certainly identify additional tasks that need to be performed, they are captured below.

- Add a summary table of the ISDT in chapter 4.
- Come up with a title for the chapter 4 ISDT.
