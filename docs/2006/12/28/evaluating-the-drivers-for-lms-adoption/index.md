title: Evaluating the drivers for LMS adoption
type: post
template: blog-post.html
---
Coates, James and Baldwin (2005) identify/propose 5 drivers behind the adoption of LMS

1. Means of increasing the efficiency of teaching
2. Promise of enriched student learning
3. The drive of new student expectations
4. Competitive pressure between institutions
5. A response to massive and increasing demands for greater access to higher education
6. A culture shift towards the control and regulation of teaching

The questions around these include

- How many, if any, institutions have stated these explicitly?
- Have they attempt any sort of evaluation about how well their choice and implementation have achieved those goals?
- Can we evaluate the current crop of LMS and their ability to respond to those drivers?

The last point is potentially the most interesting. Some initial thoughts

- Do current LMS really provide the facilities that enable an institution to control and regulate teaching? How many actually use this facility?
- Do current LMS really provide scope to improve T&L, provide greater access, or reduce costs?

In a [recent survey](http://www.irrodl.org/index.php/irrodl/article/view/219/302) of [CQU](http://www.cqu.edu.au/) staff we found the following somewhat relevant results

- Enriched student learning/improved teaching and learning  
    When asked if adoption of Blackboard would assist CQU become a flexible learning leader (one of its strategic aims) responses included
    - 56% of staff didn't know if this was the case
    - 25% thought it unlikely
    - 17% thought it likely
- Control and regulation of teaching  
    Which organisational unit should be responsible for quality of the LMS
    
    - 61% the relevant faculty
    - 27% division of teaching and learning services
    - 12% information technology division
    
    "Do you believe that implementing Blackboard is a way to place additional controls on teaching and learning activities at CQU?"
    - 44.5% yes
    - 13.3% no
    - 10% no response
    - 32.3% no difference
