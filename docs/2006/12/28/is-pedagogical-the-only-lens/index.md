Christian Dalsgaard in a [2006 paper](http://www.eurodl.org/materials/contrib/2006/Christian_Dalsgaard.htm) suggests

> Social software has initiated discussions about the extent to which tools should be separated or integrated in systems (see Levine 2004; Blackall 2005; Cormier 2005; Wilson 2005; Siemens 2005; Anderson 2006a; 2006b). However, the discussion will find no answer, unless it is placed within a context of pedagogy. Use and organization of tools within e-learning can be approached in different ways depending on the chosen pedagogy ([Dalsgaard, 2005](http://eleed.campussource.de/archive/1/78/)). Different pedagogies will have different things to say about the problem of integration vs. separation. **A discussion of the educational value of different tools must use a pedagogy as a starting point.**

There is certainly value in this perspective. But I'm not sure it is the whole picture and not sure it can even be used as the only criteria because

- There is no one pedagogy that can be used for all courses at a University.  
    Assuming of course that you are coming at this from an organisational perspective, I cannot see how any university could argue that there is one pedagogy that all staff in all courses would use. Or that there is "one right way" that should be used in all courses.
- Pedagogy is not the only reason considered  
    Again from an organisational perspective, pedagogy is not the only consideration. Certainly most decision making about technology adoption is not rational. For decision makers there will be other reasons why a technology is (or is not) chosen. </li
