[Goold and Auga (2006)](http://www.ascilite.org.au/conferences/sydney06/proceeding/html_abstracts/85.html) describe an experiment in prototyping of a transformation of a face-to-face course into an online offering.

This looks like an interesting template to use in trying out the Web 2.0 Course Site idea. The process would be something like

- Identify an existing course website or two
- Figure out how to convert them to a Web 2.0 course site  
    Which in itself encapsulates a range of interesting trade-offs. Do a purely technical translation? Aim for something more transformative?
- Grab a collection of students and staff to trial it out
- Use the feedback to return to step 2.
