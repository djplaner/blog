Pittard (2004) talks about the UK government's plans for e-learning (my bad description). It includes the following

> It prioritises seven strategic action areas that are necessary to embed elearning effectively across all sectors:
> 
> - leading sustainable e-learning implementation;
> - supporting innovation in teaching and learning;
> - developing the education workforce;
> - unifying learner support;
> - aligning assessment;
> - building a better e-learning market;
> - assuring technical and quality standards.

The first two, but especially the first point, provide support for the "web 2.0 course site" idea - i.e. e-learning provided through using SaaS (software as a service) to bring together existing services on the web.

Sustainable means, at least in part, affordabl.
