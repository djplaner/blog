A [post from Simon Fraser University](http://jasontoal.blogs.elinc.ca/2006/07/31/google-calendar-php-icalendar/) talks about use of Google Calendar with some PHP code to manage calendars and bookings.

Another potential application for Web 2.0 course sites - the study schedule as a Google calendar. Allow students to remix it with their own stuff.....lots of stuff here to think about and investigate.
