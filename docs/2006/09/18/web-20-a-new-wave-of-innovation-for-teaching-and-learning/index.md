      content: 'G''day Bryan,
    
    
        The link was easy.  Your article was much more work.
    
    
        My current interest in Web 2.0, as it has been with elearning for a while now,
        is around organisational implementation and adoption.
    
    
        Does it make sense for widespread organisational adoption?  Still an open question.
    
        How to do you encourage/support it?  Why would most people adopt it?  Particularly
        within higher education. Obviously all of these also assume you have some firmish
        idea of what web 2.0/elearning 2.0 actually is.
    
    
        Many academic staff are still struggling with using course management systems.  Organisations
        are just getting settled with CMS as they way of doing elearning.  Many senior
        management are only just getting their head around elearning 1.0
    
    
        Web 2.0 introduces a whole range of changes that are going to challenge many people
        and perceptions within Universities.
    
    
        David.'
