Have had a report from one of the students

> i am facing a problem since 14 sept. that my blog has been locked by spam blogger robot.i have tried so many times to unlock my blog but it does not unlocked yet i am going late to send my blog for week 8.

Sounds a bit like an attempt to get an extension.

Turns out that there might be [something to it](http://www.revenews.com/jeremypalmer/2006/08/my_spam_blog.html).

A "feature" in blogger that "accuses" a blog of being the source of spam and shutting it down.

Still few details from the student but it does identify issues with this approach including

- Influence of decisions by 3rd parties on the learning process
- The need for the organisation of have and share knowledge about the decisions of 3rd parties
