Many people can't see the benefits of making content freely available.

[This post](http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/archives/002625.html) suggest that it is conversation, not content, that is of strategic value in the learning process.

This is in response/connection to a [link to Yale](http://www.yale.edu/opa/newsr/06-09-19-01.all.html) making some of its courses online. An emulation of MIT's open courseware project.

This is one argument in the [Web 2.0 course site](http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/?p=15) proposal.
