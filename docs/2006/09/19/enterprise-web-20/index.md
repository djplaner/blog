Making the rounds of the blogosphere, or at least the little part I'm currently following, is [an Enterprise Web 2.0 blog](http://www.enterpriseweb2.com/) - "examining leadership and people issues raised by next-generation of web technologies".

It includes a post [Top 10 Management Fears about Enterprise Web 2.0](http://www.enterpriseweb2.com/?p=10). It includes a long list of comments and various other folk are [posting about it](http://www.innovationcreators.com/2006/07/enterprise_web_20_great_site_i.html).

These are issues that will need to be considered.
