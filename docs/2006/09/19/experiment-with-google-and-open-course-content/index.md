title: Experiment with Google and open course content
type: post
template: blog-post.html
---
Webfuse has always been based on the premise of open content, where ever possible.

On of the reasons for that is so that it can raise the profile of the organisation by our good content bringing people to CQU.

While teaching [COIS20025](http://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/Courses/2006/T2/COIS20025/) in the second half of 2006 I googled "entity relationship diagram".

Imagine my surprise when the #1 hit was, and still is, [an old Webfuse course site](http://www.infocom.cqu.edu.au/Courses/spr2000/95169/Extra_Examples/ERD.htm). Or at least a page on it.

This was a page from a course offered in the 2nd half of 2000. It's 6 years old.

The content is good, I've used it again. That's why it's a top hit.

**The Experiment**

The plan is

- Modify the page to point to [a more recent page](http://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/Courses/2006/T2/COIS20025/Assessment/Item_%32/Part_A_Resources/) which containts some of the same content that has been reworked.
- Observe whether or not the new page can climb the Google rankings.

The, very simple, measure I'm using is a simple Perl script that

- Grabs the first 1000 Google responses to a search for "entity relationship diagram"
- Lists all the URLs in that first 1000 that are in the cqu.edu.au domain.

I plan to run that script at regular periods over the next few months. I'll modify the following list each time I run it.

**Results**

- 19 September, 2006  
    Only 1 CQU domain page. The original page, ranked number 1.
- 3 October, 2006  
    Only 1 CQU domain page. The [PDF document](http://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/Courses/2006/T2/COIS20025/Assessment/Item_2/Part_A_Resources/erd.pdf) ranked as number 205 in the google list. The original page has dropped out entirely.
    
    I'm going to add a link from my personal website, which because of various reasons, I believe might be seen to be reasonably influential (in the broadest possible sense of the term). Just to see if it makes any difference.
