title: Today's knowledge climate - why Webfuse approach is better
type: post

George Siemens has a [online presentation](http://www.icwe.net/oeb_special/downloads/siemens/online_educa/player.html) intended to introduce key concepts for a [presentation](http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/archives/002636.html) he is giving at [Online Educa](http://www.online-educa.com/).

The second slide attempts to characterise today's knowledge climate. For me, each of these characteristics resonate with the ideas behind Webfuse and why a "LMS" implementation makes better sense implemented ateleologically, rather than teleologically.

The characteristics are

- Continual suspended certainty
- Connected specialisation
- Complexity and co-creation
- Continual
- Chaotic

Slide 5 is a nice representation of how life needs to stop for learning and how it no longer represents the current reality.

Slide 7 talks about the problem with plan-driven approaches and its limitations.
