[A 2005 article](http://www.digital-web.com/articles/web_2_for_designers/) outlining 6 main themes in designing a web 2.0 site

1. Writing semantic markup (transition to XML)
2. Providing Web services (moving away from place)
3. Remixing content (about when and what, not who or why)
4. Emergent navigation and relevance (users are in control)
5. Adding metadata over time (communities building social information)
6. Shift to programming (separation of structure and style)

[Another post](http://opengardensblog.futuretext.com/archives/2006/09/movietally_and_understanding_web_20_design_.html) builds on this through examination of [Movietally](http://www.movietally.com/) using the 6 themes.
