Jeremy Geelan has a [post about "Social Computing": Oxymoron - or the biggest new thing since the web itself?](http://jeremy.linuxbloggers.com/social_computing_as_biggest_big_new_thing.htm).

A nice summary overview, with some good references. Including a Forrester report that includes the following quote

> "To thrive in an era of Social Computing, companies must abandon top-down management and communication tactics, weave communities into their products and services, use employees and partners as marketers, and become part of a living fabric of brand loyalists."
