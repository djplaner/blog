> The essence of strategy is the close view of distant things and the distant view of close things -- Sun Tzu

My interest in emergent/agile approaches means I'm not a fan of strategy and/or strategic appraoches currently used in most business.

I think there is possibilities to use this quote to bring out my disquiet with this approach, at least in some contexts.

- close view of distant things  
    Assumes you can achieve such a thing. Bounded rationality, rapid change etc imply you can't, or if you do it will be imperfect.
- distant view of close things  
    Implies too little knowledge of existing practice so that strategy can become unconnected and difficult to implement.
