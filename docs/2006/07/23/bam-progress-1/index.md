It's now the end of week 2 of [CQU's](http://www.cqu.edu.au/) Term 2 for 2006. This is the first attempt at a log entry for the first test of the [BAM project](/blog/research/bam-blog-aggregation-management/) in the CQU course [COIS20025, Systems Development Overview](http://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/Courses/2006/T2/COIS20025/)

Key events this week

- Initial BAM Management interface up and going
- Concerns from staff about the workload for students and a response
- Potential problems with workload for staff
- A [Technorati](http://technorati.com/) search for "COIS20025" reveals 7 posts, including this one.
- A similar search for "systems analyst" reveals 33,908 posts including many related to this course.  
    Highlights that this use of blogs is a public medium.
- 159 of 283 students have registered their blogs
- A number of students seem to be confused about the requirements e.g.
    - Many haven't registered their blog home page, but instead the URL of their first post
    - A number believe they have to tell me, or other staff, the URL of their answer to their weekly answers.
