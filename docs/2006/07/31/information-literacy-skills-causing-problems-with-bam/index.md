The "Gantt chart" question in week 3 has caused students some problems.

The textbook only briefly mentions Gantt charts. It doesn't step by step tell the students how to do it. There is no structure. My assumption was that simple project management and using Project isn't that difficult a task for Masters level students. I was wrong.

Not surprisingly this lack of structure is the apparent root cause of the difficulties the AIC students are having. There hasn't been the same level of difficulty in evidence with the mature FLEX students.

Sachin has indicated that many of these students are literally straight off the plan. They aren't prepared. They don't have the necessary literacy skills to dive in and do this.

This highlights the issue of how and where do they receive instruction/experience with these skills? What course in the program does it?

COIS20025 could potentially do this. It could fit nicely with the week 3 requirements and week 2 system planning topics and how searching for this information is required.
