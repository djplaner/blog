      content: 'G''day Chad,
    
    
        I''m trying to figure out the rationale behind that comment.  Also the basis for
        it.  How well do you know what I''ve done or not done?  Have you been privy to
        all the considerations behind why I''m a teacher in Australia?  Do you know whether
        or not I meet your apparent, negative stereotype for "teacher"?  Am I to interpret
        this as implying that I would significantly improve my credentials around innovation
        if I moved to San Jose?
    
    
        Apart from how informed you are about me, I wonder what it is in your background
        that makes you think you are well-placed to make this comment.  I don''t know
        you and your background so I don''t know how much value to place on your comments.
    
    
        Perhaps we should have a "how big is yours" competition around innovation to see
        who is the best placed to make the decision.
    
    
        I do wonder why you''ve chosen to make this comment on this particular post.  Personally,
        I thought there were a couple of other posts I made the were much more worthy
        of this comment/question.
    
    
        The point of this blog is to provide a place where I can place my, possibly completely
        worthless, ruminations about what I''m reading and thinking about.  A place I
        can theoretically find them again rather than have the disappear out of my failing
        memory.  As ruminations they are works in practice and I am sure that in 5 years
        I will look back at many of them as naive.
    
    
        As for my being naive.  Is there some particular aspect of the comment that you
        disagree with.  It would be much more intellectually stimulating if you actually
        engaged in a discussion about what you think is naive and why rather than spend
        your time with baseless insults.
    
    
        If I were one for the ill-informed application of stereotypes, I might make a
        point about ignorant, arrogant, rude Yanks. But then I''ve known any number of
        US citizens who don''t fit that stereotype.
    
    
        Have a nice day.
    
    
        David.'

This [blog post](http://blogs.zdnet.com/Hinchcliffe/?p=68) by [Dion Hinchcliffe](http://blogs.zdnet.com/bio.php#hinchcliffe) includes a link to the mp3 of talk by [Andrew McAfee](http://blog.hbs.edu/faculty/amcafee/) at a conference. According to [another blog](http://webbizculture.blogspot.com/2006/09/impending-failure-of-standalone.html) Andrew claims to be the guy who coined Enterprise 2.0.

Yet to listen to the talk, but it appears to include much good stuff, however, the blog post does have a lot of important points to consider when thinking about the implementation of Web 2.0 into the enterprise.

Some of the points that resonated with me include

- The idea that Enterprise 2.0 is about free form, emergent IT. An idea I've been trying to push in the LMS arena, and failing.
- The idea of using the [PeopleFinder project as an example](http://web2.wsj2.com/finding_the_real_web_20.htm) of high-value emergent use of social software
- The limitations of current enterprise IT provision and the difficulties it creates
- The need to drastically change much of this practice before emergent social software can flourish
- The problem implied by the observation that only a very small percentage of the population actively contributes (e.g. to a site like Wikipedia). Scaling this down to an enterprise means that the number of contributors is vanishingly small. An idea taken a bit further, [here](http://webbizculture.blogspot.com/2006/09/impending-failure-of-standalone.html)
