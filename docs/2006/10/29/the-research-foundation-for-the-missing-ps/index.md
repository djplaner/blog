The work on [the missing Ps](http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/?p=52) is intended to contribute some research publications within the information systems field and also form the structure for chapter 2 of my PhD thesis. Consequently, it is important that the work have a good research foundation. This post is intended to provide that foundation, or at least document my development of the foundation.

The attempt is to develop a descriptive type of theory, a framework or taxonomy. Literature that talks about this type of research, appropriate processes and content include

- [They Cycles of Theory Building in Management Research](http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/5422.html) by Paul Carlile and Clayton Chrstensen
- [The nature of theory in information systems](http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/Reading/Information_Systems/) by Shirley Gregor
