George Siemens has posted a [document](http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/wordpress/?p=15) entitled "Learning or Management System? A Review of Learning Management System Reviews" which, as the title suggests, reviews a recent collection of reviews of LMSes in an attempt to offer a more nuanced view.

The abstract states

> The position offered in this report encourages an organizational definition of learning as the starting point for selecting a technology platform for creating and delivery learning content. A clear definition of learning vision and desired future states, created through input from stakeholders (administrators, faculty, students, and information services) should provide the foundation for decision making, and the boundaries of platform selection.

This is extremely timely given I've only just recently embarked publically on the development of my ["missing Ps framework"](http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/?p=52). My attempt at organising all of the flaws and problems I have with how institutions of higher education are currently going about the process of selecting an LMS.

I find myself agreeing with much of what is in the document. However, I also think there is more here, a broader perspective to be considered.

For example, the quote from the abstract above strongly suggests that an "organisational definition of learning" should be the starting point for this process. In a perfect world I would agree but I have two arguments against this.

1. Establishing an organisational definition is likely impossible and may in fact be damaging in the short and long term. Have you ever tried to get two academics to agree on anything? How about two academics from different disciplines? Most of the organisational definitions of anything created by Universities are often so general as to be meaningless. If it isn't so high level the definition means that some part of the organisational community has be sidelined. Their understanding, their definition deemed not to be acceptable to the organisation. This loss of diversity is often problematic for the institution. Finally, I'm sure if you could find an organisational definition of learning from 5, 10 or 50 years ago, it would be considerably different from the definition in vogue/use today. Such definitions can be a drag.
2. Is learning always the primary focus behind the selection of an LMS? Sure, most places pay lip service to the rhetoric that the decision is all about learning. But scratch the surface and there is often a very different reason. If you take the perspective that LMSes do little or nothing to support learning then perhaps it's acceptable for an organisation to choose a different purpose.

The starting place I would suggest should be that the organisation state up-front what is the purpose the tool will be put to. Why does the organisation need it and what is it hoped you can achieve.

The purpose might, hopefully would, include a significant/primary focus on learning. But I think honesty is more valuable in this sort of decision than lip service.

This seems to connect with a quote in the paper from [Wise and Quealy](http://www.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/telars/talmet/melbmonash/media/LMSGovernanceFinalReport.pdf) (2006)

> âthe educational significance of LMS is largely overemphasized and misunderstood â¦\[suggesting it is critical for a university to\] â¦ understand itselfâwhat it values, what it does well and how it does it, what it would like to do, and how it might do thisâ?
