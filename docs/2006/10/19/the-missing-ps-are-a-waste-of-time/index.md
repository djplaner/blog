[The missing Ps framework](http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/?p=52) is very much under construction attempt to identify the holes and flaws in the methods used by Universities to evaluate and select a learning management system (LMS).

In reading around about this topic, in particular via a [document from George Siemens](http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/?p=54), I came across a report funded by the Melbourne-Monash Collaboration in Educational Technologies, [LMS Governance Project Report](http://www.infodiv.unimelb.edu.au/telars/talmet/melbmonash/media/LMSGovernanceFinalReport.pdf) (Wise and Quealy, 2006).

Skimming through this report I was struck by the following quote from the foreword

> We were also very mindful of the number of internal and external reviews of LMS and educational technology (not all of which were made available to us) and the **lack of impact these reports appear to have had in decision-making**.

A great little quote to bring me back to ground. The best that can come from this idea of the missing Ps is that I get a few publications and hopefully a couple of trips to nice places. Assuming you ignore the personal value that will be generated by simply reading and thinking about this stuff.
