[The Missing Ps framework](http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/?p=52) is my attempt to generate a way of identifying the flaws in the methods used by Universities to select an LMS.

This post looks at perceptions.

The sections will include

- Perceptions drive adoption
- IT perceived as a cost
- Sub-cultures drive perceptions

**Perceptions drive adoption**

(The following is a bit of plagiarism from a [previous post](http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/?p=48).)

If you draw on the information systems literature you come to [TAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_acceptance_model) (I [talked about this before](http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/?p=48)) which posits two main factors influencing adoption of technology

1. Perceived ease of use
2. Perceived usefulness

Perceived usefulness is defined as

> The degree to which a person believes that using a particular system would enhance his or her job performance.

A [recent EDUCAUSE Review article](http://www.educause.edu/er/erm06/erm0643.asp) focused on finding out what faculty and students want from future LMSes contains reference to this.

> For the most part, faculty members expressed a desire for easier-to-use functions that would reduce time and effort on their part. As one noted: âMaybe it canât be made easier, but it shouldnât be made harder.â? Grading papers, entering grades, and returning files were seen as barriers that do not in exist in the traditional classroom but that are enormously problematic in the L/CMS environment.

Consequently

> Tools provided within an L/CMS are not, in general, utilized to their fullest capacity. The interviewees gave many reasons for this phenomenon. The amount of time needed to use many tools demands too much of both learner and instructor. The need to change teaching styles in order to incorporate collaborative tools is not rewarded by the institution.

**IT perceived as a cost**

IT continues to be seen by higher education as a cost to be minimised.

**Sub-cultures drive perceptions**
