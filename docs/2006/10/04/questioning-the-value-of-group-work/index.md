For a number of the educators I know group work is a magical solution the promises great improvement to the effectiveness of their courses.

Personally, I've always had a problem. Since the mid-1990s I've believed that most of the probles I see with group work comes from the need for there to be inter-dependence between the members of the group. That is the performance of each member of the group is intertwined with the performance/contribution of other members of the group. Get in a group full of experts and you'll perform well, get a group of dunces...

So the thought was, if you could get collaboration without the inter-dependence you might avoid the problems and have generate some other benefits.

From the brevity of that it's not hard to see I didn't spend a lot of time on it.

Over the last week or so there has been a range of resources circulating that question the value of group work including:

- [What's Next: The Idiocy of Crowds](http://www.inc.com/magazine/20060901/column-freedman.html) - a magazine article slagging off at the wisdom of crowds stuff. Some interesting points but appears to be going to far the other way.
- [To ungroup a class](http://www.teachandlearn.ca/blog/2006/10/03/to-ungroup-a-class/) - a blog post from the blog of proximal development reflecting on the value or otherwise of his preference not to engage his students in group work
- And last, but no means least, [Stephen Downes](http://www.downes.ca/) recent growing meme comparing [groups and networks](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4126240905912531540&hl=en)
