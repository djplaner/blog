One of the problems with arguing a "Web 2.0 course site" to many academics is the fact that the content is open. This is still incredibly troubling to a large percentage of academics (must find out how prevalent).

One, not very strong, argument against this feeling is demonstrating the amount of free material already available. Such as [this list of computer science video lectures](http://freescienceonline.blogspot.com/2006/06/free-computer-science-video-lecture_24.html).

It's actually a [blog for free science, video lectures](http://freescienceonline.blogspot.com/) and includes similar for mathematics, biology, chemistry, physics, and engineering.
