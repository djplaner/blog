title: Everything old is new again - working around copy detection

[The Age newspaper](http://www.theage.com.au/) has a [story](http://www.theage.com.au/news/national/web-offers-cheats-tailormade-assignments/2006/09/29/1159337339350.html) about how students are "plagiarising" by purchasing purpose writen assignments from various websites.

We first implemented a form of copy detection with Webfuse in about 2000/2001. We knew this could be worked around by purpose written stuff then. A couple of years later and students at CQU have been caught calling for bids from people to write their programming assignments for the students.

This isn't new.

Another opportunity lost for research and a bit of publicity. :(
