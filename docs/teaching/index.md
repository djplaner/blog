A number of the web links below are broken because of changes within organisations and the technology they use for e-learning.

### 2018-

I've shifted out of a teaching role into one that helps teachers.

### 2012-2017

Have shifted disciplines. Now teaching education at the [University of Southern Queensland](http://www.usq.edu.au). USQ uses Moodle and the course sites are generally restricted. Teaching responsibilities have included

- EDC3100, ICT and Pedagogy (2012-2016) [Blog posts](/blog2/category/edc3100/) related to the course.
- EDU8117, [Networked and Global Learning](http://www.usq.edu.au/course/specification/2015/EDU8117-S2-2015-WEB-TWMBA.html) (2013-2016)- with a [public site](http://netgl.wordpress.com). [Blog posts](/blog2/category/edu8117/) related to the course.
- EDS4406, [Secondary Computing Curriculum and Pedagogy](http://www.usq.edu.au/course/synopses/2015/EDS4406.html) (2015-2016) [Blog posts](/blog2/category/eds4406/) related to the course.
- EDM8006, Humanities Curriculum & Pedagogical Studies 2: Arts & Technologies (2016)

### 2007-2010

2007-2010 I have been employed by Central Queensland University in a [role designed](/blog2/2009/08/20/elearning-and-innovation-specialist-report-1-4-20-august)/ (and the odd other role) to help academics improve their learning and teaching.

### 2006

In the 2nd half of 2006 I moved to teaching Information Systems courses. I'm currently coordinating [COIS20025, Systems Development Overview](http://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/Courses/2006/T2/COIS20025/). I'm likely to be involved with this course for the next year or so, at the least. As part of this I've adapted some past CQU material into a [PDF](https://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/Courses/2006/T2/COIS20025/Assessment/Item_2/Part_A_Resources/erd.pdf ) explaning how to develop entity relationship diagrams. This link is being included as part of an [experiment](http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/?p=24) with free content and its google ranking.

For the first half of 2006 I coordinated the course [COIT11134, Procedural Programming](http://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/Courses/2006/T1/COIT11134/).

### 2005

From March to June 2005 I am coordinating [COIT11134](http://www.infocom.cqu.edu.au/Courses/2005/T1/COIT11134/) Programming B (C++)

### 2004

From July-Oct 2004 I will be providing the lectures, tutorials and labs for two courses

1. COIT11133, Programming A - [main course site](http://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/Courses/2004/T3/COIT11133/)
2. COIT11134, Programming B - [main course site](http://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/Courses/2004/T3/COIT11134/)

### 2002

In July-Oct 2002 I was involved with two courses

1. [MMST11002, Constructing Cyberspace](http://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/Courses/2002/T3/MMST11002/)Running a single tute for Rockhampton students.
2. [Practical Web Engineering](http://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/Courses/2002/T3/COIT13148/Course_Site/COIT13148b/)Running a special topic course for IT students.

### 2000-2004

During most of this time I was the Faculty of Informatics and Communication's Teaching and Learning Innovation officer. This basically meant that I was leading the development of Webfuse, the collection of information systems that supported the operations of the faculty.

### Pre-2000

I was the CQU teacher of the year in 2000 for the work on the following courses.

Way back when I taught

- 85321, Systems AdministrationThis course was created in the early 90s and has been taught in a primarily online mode in [1996](http://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/Units/aut98/85321//Old_Stuff/1996_Website/85321/) and [1997](http://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/Archives/Units/1998/Autumn/85321_Systems_Administration/Old_Stuff/1997_Website/), [1998](http://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/Units/aut98/85321/), [1999](http://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/Units/aut99/85321/), [2000](http://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/85321/)
- 85349, Operating SystemsI have taught this course on and off since 1993. The latest version made [heavy use of the Web](http://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/85349/).
