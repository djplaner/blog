One of these days I plan/hope to have the time to catch up on some reading that I have let slide over the last couple of years. To this end this post marks a new practice. I'm using a "to read" category on this blog to save some detail of things I need to come back to, read more carefully and follow up on some of the references.

First cab off the rank is this Neil Selwyn [essay](http://www.educationarena.com/pdf/sample/sample-essay-selwyn.pdf) titled "Social Media in Higher Education". As I'm skimming it now there seems to be more to come back to. Especially some of the more recent references to various suggestions about trends in e-learning. Including the expected, if slightly cringe worthy, "pedagogy 2.0".
