And another weekly reflection of tasks and learning associated with a course. This one is for the Literacy and Numeracy course.

### Context and background

Interesting that this course has a study guide that starts with an overview of the theoretical assumptions that underpinned the design of the course. This courses uses two concepts

1. multiliteracies; and
2. transformative learning.

and goes on for some time explaining and showing how that connects with the course design.

### Literacy and numeracy issues in changing times

The assumption is that times are changing, the aim here is to reflect on those changes and the implications they have for changing "literacies" for the types of practices we'd engage in as educators.

And we're into definitions, first three important terms

1. Language - "system of signs and symbols used by a group of human beings to construct meaning. Different groups may develop different systems...resulting in different languages...Groups may use their language in different ways".
2. Literacy - "ability to read and use written information and to write appropriate in a range of contexts...integration of speaking, listening, viewing and critical thinking with reading and writing and includes cultural knowledge".
3. Numeracy - "To be numerate is to use mathematics effectively to meet the general demands of life as home, in paid work, and for participation in community and civic life.....involves the disposition to use, in context, a combination of: unnderpinning mathematical concepts and skills...(numerical spatial, graphical, statistical and algebraic); mathematical thinking and strategies; general thinking skills, and; grounded appreciation of context.

Which of courses raises the question of whether or not mathematics is a language and thus numeracy can be folded into literacy.

Again with this course there doesn't seem to be the one single resource that is explaining what it is students are meant to do. There seems to be multiple bits with each not necessarily describing the same task.

#### What are the key concepts or issues here?

Due to on-going change - change from the social, technological and economic - create a need to identify new ways of thinking about literacy. New ways of equipping students with the skills to combine existing and new literacy skills "in different ways, for new purposes and with new technologies". The argument is for a move away from a predominant emphasis on the print - i.e. literacy == reading and writing English (insert other language) texts.

#### What is similar to or different from what I already knew?

To some limited extent I was familiar with most of this, perhaps not in terms of an integrated, reasonably in-depth argument.

#### What did I have difficulty with?

My perception of excess verbiage and the document not being as well designed as it could have been. i.e. The first page essentially summarises the 11 page document but doesn't sign post that it does so I have to end up skimming/reading all of the pages to double check I'm not missing anything.

#### What did I disagree with, and why?

I have an inbuilt initial skepticism about arguments based on the idea that "the world has changed and continues to change". So my main source of disagreement arises from that. That said, however, I tend to agree in general with the argument expressed here.

In terms of the specific changes mentioned there may be some disagreements. For example, I'm not sure that digital TVs are really a significant change from what has gone before in terms of literacies. Oh, there are more channels, but that's been there with pay TV etc.

In terms of K12 education, I'm uncertain that it needs to provide support for all possible literacies, but then I'm not sure that the document claims that.

#### Are there things I need to know more about?

There are a few more questions that ask how these "new" concepts would influence how I think about school/community, teaching etc.

Given that this argument is not all that new to me, I don't think it will have any great impact on changing my thinking or practice.

mmmm, not sure I'm getting much out of this activity.

#### Assessing multiliteracies and the new basics

Now it's on to Kalantzis, Cope and Harvey (2003) and looking to answer the following questions

- What are the two changes argued as the "most important and closely related changes" in the way people communicate?  
    
- Do you agree/disagree with the basic argument for the concept of "Multiliteracies" as being a way of understanding the changes in how we are communicating?  
    
- Why?  
    

So, first there were difficulties in figuring out which article we were meant to read. Then, my PLN in the form of @sthcrft [posted this to amplify](http://sthcrft.amplify.com/2011/03/04/a-pedagogy-of-multiliteracies/) which in turn points to [this article](http://wwwstatic.kern.org/filer/blogWrite44ManilaWebsite/paul/articles/A_Pedagogy_of_Multiliteracies_Designing_Social_Futures.htm) by the "London Group" which are related to the above. But also in the same period, the teaching staff have fixed up the link and [pointed to this page](http://newlearningonline.com/multiliteracies/references/). It includes this more recent reference

> Cope, Bill and Mary Kalantzis, ‘Multiliteracies: New Literacies, New Learning’, Pedagogies: An International Journal, Vol.4, 2009, pp.164-195.

The activity suggests we answer

- What are the two changes argued as most important in terms of how folk communicate?  
    At the moment, it appears to be: multilingual and multimodal. Multilingual is the growth of different "languages" in professional, national, ethnic, subcultural and other contexts. Multimodal refers to ideas of linguistic, visual, audio, gestural and spatial models of meaning. i.e. moving beyond alphabetical literacy.
- Do you agree/disagree with the basic argument for multiliteracies.  
    Essentially yes.
- Why?  
    In large part because I have experienced the need to develop these multiliteracies in my own work within e-learning and have observed the negatives that arise from those folk that haven't developed the same skills. Perhaps the best example are the multiple literacies involved in producing an academic conference paper, the accompanying powerpoint slides, giving the presentation and increasingly changes arising from handling the back channel during the presentation.

They do mention the two types of approach/"how"

- The "techno-rational" (my term) focused on rules and good practice from literacy models; and
- The progressive focused on "immersion or natural learning models"..situated practice.

In examining the why of education or literacies (a foundational argument) they present two loose categories

- Rightish - focused on education as provide equity, the ability/opportunity to become what students like.
- Leftish - seeing the goal of education as equality. A reduction of the gap between the haves and have-nots.

Both of which education fails to provide. And while it is not working, literacy continues to make these promises.

What is suggested as changing is the increasing importance allocated to education as part of the "knowledge economy".

Okay, they now make this argument in more detail by looking at groups

- Workers;  
    Interesting argument about how "new capitalism" is doing away with the rigid hierarchies and top-down discourse of the old ways. Obviously not reflecting what is happening in some universities. Similarly, the old style study of the 3Rs. I think they are being a bit over-optimistic. The idea is that multiliteracies are meant to provide what is needed for the new capitalism. Ahh, they do pick this up a bit.
- Citizens;  
    Touching on the growth and now reduction of the "welfare" state and neoliberalism. Subsequent reduction in state funding, education as a market etc and the subsequent interest in simple solutions. Additional argument about the rise of self-governing structures in civil society. All leading to the idea that the nature of citzenship is changing.
- People.  
    A trend from a command society to a society of reflexivity. i.e. of people taking more active parts in activities such as gaming, etc...the prosumer thing probably fits here. Thought at the same time there is centalisation of ownership of media groups. "Diversity is pivotal in today's life-worlds".

> The logic of multiliteracies is one that recognizes that meaning making is an active, transformative process, and a pedagogy based on that recognition is more likely to open up viable life courses for a world of change and diversity...When developing the key ideas for a pedagogy of multiliteracies a decade ago, we sought to replace static conceptions of representation such as “grammar” and “the literary canon” with a dynamic conception of representation as “design”
