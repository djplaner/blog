      content: 'What strikes me as odd here is how "revolution" has become such a buzzword.
        Call someone a revolutionary and it still sounds like a slur. Say you support
        the learning revolution and people invite you to their coffee mornings. Odd.
    
    
        Part of the explanation why so many blue-rinse people are bandying around the
        word "revolution" (I think) is that it really doesn''t amount to much of a revolution.
        In fact it doesn''t deserve to be called a revolution. Revolutions were meant
        to usher in a new historical epoch - one with a new set of social relations. Sir
        Ken Robinson and his supporters are not talking about any such thing. They just
        want education to catch up with the post-Fordist economy. The old schools were
        slaves to the economy. The new digital schools will be slaves to the new digital
        economy. It wasn''t about the kids (or society) then, and it''s not about the
        kids now. It''s about business. When it''s people in pin-stripe suits who are
        calling for the revolution, it''s time to be a little suspicious.'

The presentation slides below are the basis for a talk I'll be giving this Thursday as part of my study toward a Graduate Diploma in Learning and Teaching. The aim is to analyse the [Digital Education Revolution (DER)](http://www.digitaleducationrevolution.gov.au/) and identify any shortcomings and strengths (hint: I found it heavy on the former and light on the latter). The talk is being done in Elluminate to other students. Don't know the connection details, but if you wanted to participate I could chase that up. Let me know.

In summary, my conclusion (which is not likely to be all that novel) is that the DER is pleasing in that it represents a fairly significant engagement (in terms of money) by the Federal Government with the question of teaching, learning, schooling and technology. The trouble is, however, that because of various flaws I think it unlikely that the DER will achieve its goal. At best it will remove some of the first order barriers - mostly student access to computers - for the next few years. Though even that will be somewhat limited - depending on how schools implement 1:1 - and is likely to cease in the near future when the DER funding ceases and other factors (tightening budget constrains, potential change of government, likely limited outcomes from the DER) play out.

The biggest problem with the DER is that it is based on the assumption that the coming "digital world" requires new approaches to teaching and learning and it believes this can be done solely by adding technology for students. It seems to assume that the coming "digital world" can be served well by the current industrial model inherent in schools and being reinforced by other Government policies such as the National Curriculum.

Given the huge number of possible perspectives that could be brought to bare on the DER, the presentation is by no means complete. But it is also a bit more complicated than I would like. The trouble is that other assignments are calling and time has run out.
