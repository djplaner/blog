The purpose of this post is to make formal what many people have already assumed. Work on [BIM and BIM for Moodle 2.0](/blog/research/bam-blog-aggregation-management/) is not really happening at the moment. I've already missed the "early 2011" release of BIM for Moodle 2 I was aiming for and have been incredibly slack in solving [an issue](https://github.com/djplaner/BIM/issues#issue/33) with BIM for Moodle 1.9 and Yahoo Pipes.

This announcement doesn't mean BIM development will cease, just that it will be delayed somewhat while I complete other tasks. In particular, my current full-time study has to take some priority. Who knows in the absence of guilt about not delivering, I may get back to it sooner rather than later.

My apologies to to anyone that this will negatively impact.

The code is all on github: [BIM for Moodle 1.9](https://github.com/djplaner/BIM) and [BIM for Moodle 2.0](https://github.com/djplaner/bimtwo), people are free to get on with it. Though I'm not sure I'd wish my code on anyone.
