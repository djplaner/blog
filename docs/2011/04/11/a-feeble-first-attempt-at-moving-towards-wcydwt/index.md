Late last week I was thinking about how I could develop something approaching a [WCYDWT lesson](http://blog.mrmeyer.com/?category_name=what-can-you-do-with-this) for mathematics. It is something I am going to have to do very soon now. As it happens, in looking for the WCYDWT link, I came across [this Diigo group](http://groups.diigo.com/group/wcydwt) that I am going to have to return to.

The following is a first attempt. Actually, it's the first example of me seeing something in my everyday life that I can connect to the curriculum and see some ideas for developing a lesson. Given that I am going to have to be developing lessons soon, I'm hoping to get into this practice more.

This type of thing may not connect directly with the strictures (if such exist) of WCYDWT. I guess I am using that as a useful label to encourage me to structure lessons that ask the students to generate the questions (which I am hopefully strongly guiding towards the curriculum) in the hope that it is more meaningful and interesting to them and consequently leads to better outcomes. The ultimate aim being to encourage them to see the relevance of mathematics.

### A comparison of Household finances - The McGuffin

[The Weekend Australian Magazine](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/weekend-australian-mag) from last weekend had a "Trend Tracker" column on infographics (can't find it online) which led with some infographics comparing Australian household finances from 1971 to those for 2011. The following table summarises the figures. In a lesson, I'd probably go with the graphics or some form of multimedia.

| Figure | 1971 | 2011 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Average price of a home | $21,000 | $557,000 |
| Average grocery bill | $23 | $250 |
| Average household size | 3.3 | 2.6 |
| Average # of cars per dwelling | 0.75 | 1.5 |
| Average # of household appliances and gadgets | 9 | 27 |
| Average wage | $84 | $1250 |

This is one of the difficulties that I see with WCYWDT type problems, while I can see a number of questions that arise from this prompt, what will the students see? Of course, that is also one of the interesting aspects of this type of problem.

Within the Queensland syllabus, this seems to fit with "Chance and Data" and discussions of averages/means, but also with decimals, money and a few other places. Making these connections is one of the skills I need to develop further.

Some of the questions I can see (feel free to suggest more)

- What does it mean to have 2.6 people in a household?  
    The notion of averages etc.
- Given the costs of houses, groceries etc and the average wage, are people better off or worse?  
    Apart from the calculations, there are a range of further questions - not necessarily mathematical questions - about what "better off" means. i.e. do 27 gadgets make you better off than 9 etc.
- What were the maximum and minimum values for these averages?  
    Leading into more questions about what "average" actually means

An extension of this, somewhat fraught with peril, would be to get the students to provide data to do an in-class calculation of equivalent figures. Some possibilities might include

- Real figures from home.  
    i.e. bring in the grocery bill, Mum and Dad's group certificate....obviously there are some major privacy issues arising from this approach.
- Actually start with the students providing their figures.  
    i.e. start the lesson with students in groups talking about how much they would like to earn, how much they think the would need to spend on groceries etc. Or perhaps ask them to provide the minimum, just right and maximum wages they'd like to earn (a Goldilocks approach). Get the class playing with those figures and then reveal the national figures.

An obvious extension to this would be to get access to the [ABS](http://www.abs.gov.au/) raw data and see what other interesting data can be pulled from there, but also see if there are ways to get the students mining and manipulating that data.

Another option might be to get some average salary figures for different occupations (perhaps from the ABS) to give the students some idea of the range of salaries and then also to use those as data points to illustrate the concept of average. i.e. some occupations are above and some are below.

Which obviously leads into some of those survey results where everyone thinks they are average.
