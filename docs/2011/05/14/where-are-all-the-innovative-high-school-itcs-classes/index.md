title: Where are all the innovative high school IT/CS classes?
type: post
template: blog-post.html

This post is a request for pointers to the examples of really innovative/effective/different high school classes in Information Technology (IT/IPT) or Computer Science (CS). Even with just 10 days of prac teaching within a school setting, I can recognise the rationale and constraints that contribute to the use of the apparently typical curriculum. I would, however, like to break that mould and do something different. I'm assuming/hoping that I'm not the first and would like to benefit from the experience and ideas of others.

The rest of the post outlines the status quo I see, the rationale, and the examples I've found so far.

### Status quo

So far, all of the IT courses I've seen follow the same path. Students are introduced to project management, the software development life cycle (SDLC), a bit of artificial intelligence, creating a web page/site, database design and development and programming. The tools are usually the Microsoft suite, especially Access (for database) and Visual Basic (for programming).

The programming/database tasks are usually "pretend" systems. e.g. a local restaurant wants a system to take customer orders. Students are taught procedural programming using things like nassi-schneiderman diagrams etc.

### Rationale

I have a significant disbelief in the benefit of the SDLC and similarly with the traditional psuedo-code/nassi-schneiderman approach to teaching programming. I also think that "pretend" systems development where the teacher plays the role of client, project manager, user and teacher is less than ideal for giving students a taste of the real challenge and excitement of IT. Much of this distate arises from teaching first year programming at University level a few years ago and seeing first hand how such approach destroy the joy that is software development.

I also have an assignment in which I'm meant to design a unit plan that demonstrates effective integration of ICTs into teaching. I'm thinking of doing this around a senior IT class.

### What I've found so far

Based on previous experience, I am aware of a number of approaches/tools that aim to make programming more interesting. I'm pretty sure that some of these will have been applied to high school classes. The list includes:

- [Media computation](http://coweb.cc.gatech.edu/mediaComp-teach) - "a contextualized approach to introducing computing using a ubiquitous theme of manipulating media".
- Simple programming languages/environments such as [Squeak](http://www.squeak.org/), [Scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) and [Alice](http://www.alice.org/)

For more specific high school examples, I thought I'd start with a look at the websites/conferences of a couple of Australian professional associations (e.g. [QSITE](http://qsite.edu.au)). Here's what I found.

Apparently, at least in 2009, Education Queensland allowed high school teachers to host PHP/MySQL on its servers. There's also a bit more on different tools, but not much that I could see (with a limited search) on pedagogy or approach.

A bit of a broader search doesn't reveal a great deal..I'm obviously not looking in the right places.
