This time next year I should probably be teaching high school IT and maths. Because of this I've been thinking a lot about what type of teacher/educator/facilitator I'd like to be. What will be my ethos? I'm sure I'll be asked that in coming weeks as I study.

[This talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS2IPfWZQM4&feature=player_embedded) from Chris Lehman captures a significant part of what I've been thinking about.

Making high school not suck. Engaging with students in making stuff that matters.

How that can be achieved within the constraints of existing organisations should be interesting.
