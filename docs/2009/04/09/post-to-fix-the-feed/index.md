It appears that [this post](/blog2/2009/04/06/birnbaums-fad-cycle-in-higher-education/) and its use of a poll has broken the RSS feed for this blog. Am hoping that this post will knock that post out of the feed.

Yep, that worked. Tip: don't use polls in Wordpress.com blogs. They appear to break the RSS feed.
