Given my pre-occupation with the [thesis](/blog/research/phd-thesis/), which involves the formulation of a design theory for e-learning. It's of little surprise that I have an interest in the theory, practice and e-learning. Came across the following quote this morning in checking some literature, and I like it - new quote for a thesis chapter.

> Theory without practice leads to an empty idealism, and action without philosophical reflection leads to mindless activism. â€“ Elias & Merriam, 1980, p. 4

Currently this quote speaks to me because I observe the practice of e-learning within universities being performed with zero philosophical reflection.

The quote is the lead in to an article that is talked about [here](http://www.edtechpost.ca/wordpress/2008/05/26/kanuka-article-tech-philosophy-in-practice/) and more recently [here](http://damosworld.wordpress.com/2009/04/05/philosophies-of-technology-technological-determinism/)
