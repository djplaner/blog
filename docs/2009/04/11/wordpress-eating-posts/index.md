This is not good. It seems that Wordpress.com is starting to eat posts.

Earlier today I added a post about a photo of mine from Flickr, licensed under creative commons that has been picked up and used by an online mapping service. I link that with the 80/20 rule and a Ted talk by Clay Shirky

The post no long lives on the Wordpress blog. However, there were a few visits to the post, so it exists (somewhat) in the stats. Even though it now points to another, much older, blog post. The post also exists in Google as originally intended.

This is not a good sign for reliance on a 3rd party.

I can hear all the SaaS, cloud computing skeptics in IT divisions across the world working up to...."I told you so".
