      content: 'Hi David, I''ve been reading your blogg with interest. I''m doing a Master
        of Arts in e-learning in Sydney. Actually not really interested in BAM - I was
        reading your ideas re Convery 2009 - Journal of teachers and teaching. I''m doing
        two subjects this semester in e-learning. So it''s new to me. Did you read gseiemens
        blog site - he suggests New Criteria for New Media - http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/
        and also expressed concerns about ''leveraging of the human network''. Anyway
        - I was amused with the idea of ''pedagogy of the impressed'' - Convery. I''m
        just new to this field as mentioned and I''m trying to reconcile - notions of
        ''learning object affordances'' with things I''m reading in the Journal of Learning
        Design QUT publication - for example: the keynote article on ''Unlearning pedagogy''.
    
        I seem to be reading articles that are critical about inequities within societies
        on the one hand and at the same time authors are using language that arises from
        entirely different models. For example, Montesano et al on Learning object affordances:
        ''we demonstrate successful learning in the real world by having an humanoid robot
        interacting with objects etc. Some other people I;ve met seem to have formed the
        view that things are quite clear cut. However, I have the impression that perhaps
        some e-learning visionaries are using the language of cognitive science/robotics
        and ....we jsut may not be very clear about precisley what we are proposing? Maijann
        http://maija30.edublogs.org    Also there was a little glitche I think when I
        was trying to find your blog address and I think you could be studying at my home
        town -  where I grew up. The Brahmans are a give-away, if so.'

      content: 'G''day Maijann,
    
    
        Am glad you''re finding the blog interesting.  I must admit that my connection
        with e-learning is mostly associated with how to design/support the technology
        used to enable it within universities.  I''m not directly researching/thinking
        about the pedagogical side of things, though it is important and I have learned
        somethings.
    
    
        One of the conclusions I''ve reached in my work is that there isn''t a lot of
        clarity to be gained with any certainty around how to understand learning and
        teaching.  Mainly because there are so many perspectives.  There''s always another
        one.  Which does make it interesting as to what is being discussed.
    
    
        As for location, I am based in the "cattle capital of Australia" and we actually
        run a few head ourselves.
    
    
        David.'

[BAM - Blog Aggregation Management](/blog/research/bam-blog-aggregation-management/) is a project I started in early 2006 to play around with two sets of ideas:

1. learning; and  
    Building on some ideas of using blogs for individual student reflective journals in an attempt to increase the visibility of their progress and enable increased levels of student/teacher interaction.
2. technical.  
    Extending one of the [initial ideas of Webfuse](/blog/publications/the-design-of-an-integrated-online-learning-environment/) ("maximise adaptability by concentrating on providing the infrastructure required to integrate existing and yet to be developed online learning tools") into the wonderful world of Web 2.0.

The initial experiment in the second half of 2006 has been the topic of [a report for a website](/blog/publications/blogs-reflective-journals-and-aggregation-an-initial-experiment/) and some blog posts. However, late last year [Jo](http://fabie.cqu.edu.au/FCWViewer/staff.do?site=536&sid=LUCKJ) and I submitted a paper to [EdMedia'2009](http://www.aace.org/conf/edmedia/). It was accepted, but I or the reviewers were not entirely happy with the paper, so some changes have been made.

Consequently, the [next to final version](/blog/publications/blog-aggregation-management-reducing-the-aggravation-of-managing-student-blogging/) of the paper is now available. It's better than the version that was accepted, but still not great. At least it tells the story with a bit of reflection.

Not a great paper but it's one of two Jo will present in Hawaii.

As for the future of BAM, that all depends on what's happening with work. At the very least BAM is taking a back seat to the PhD, for a while.
