I've bitten the bullet and have decided to use [Wordpress blog](http://coursedesign.wordpress.com/) to support the [6 hour orientation to course analysis and design](/blog2/2009/01/28/the-design-of-a-6-hour-orientation-to-course-analysis-and-design/) I'm supposed to run next week.

It's probably going to be much more work than I should or planned to put in, but so far it's been fairly easy. It may be worthwhile.
