It's that time of year again, next week I get to run a session with 20 or so new [CQU](http://www.cqu.edu.au/) academics looking at course analysis and design. The session is part of a [four day program](http://learning.cqu.edu.au/orientation/program.htm) entitled [Foundations of University Learning and Teaching](http://learning.cqu.edu.au/orientation/index.htm) (FoULT). The session is run twice a year.

The following post gives an overview of some of my thinking behind the session this year. The sessions won't really be finalised until the sessions are over, so if you have any feedback or suggestions, fire away.

### Constraints

The following constraints apply

- The session lasts 6 hours.
- I'm told there will be 24 participants, I expect less than that.
- I'll be the only facilitator.
- The participants are required to do this as part of the employment and some may be less than enthusiastic, though there are generally some very keen participants.
- The sessions will be held in a computer lab. The computers are arranged around the walls of the room and there is a table without computers in the middle of the room.
- 3 hours after lunch on one day and the 3 hours before lunch the following day.
- The participants will be a day and a half into the four days by the time they get to this session (information overload kicking in).
- Earlier on the first day they will have done sessions on "knowledge management" and assessment - moderation and marking.
- The title of the sessions is "course analysis and design" so should probably do something close to that.
- I don't have the time to do a lot of work because of time constraints and other responsibilities.
- Have done this session a few times before (slides from the last time are [Introduction](http://www.slideshare.net/davidj/1-introduction-to-cddu-presentation), [Implementation](http://www.slideshare.net/davidj/2-implementation-presentation), [Analysis](http://www.slideshare.net/davidj/3-analysis-presentation) and [design](http://www.slideshare.net/davidj/4-design-presentation)) so that experience will constrain my thinking.
- Theoretically, I don't believe that there is much chance of radically changing minds or developing expertise in new skills. The best I can hope for is sparking interest, raising awareness and pointing them in the right direction.

### The plan

I'm thinking that the session should aim to

- Make people aware of the tools and support currently available to help with their teaching.
- Introduce them to some concepts or ideas that may lead them to re-think the assumptions on which they base their course design.
- Introduce them to some resources and ideas that may help them design their courses.

Activities during the session will include

- Some presentation of ideas using video and images.
- Discussion and sharing of responses and their own ideas via in class discussion but also perhaps through the [CDDU wiki](http://cddu.cqu.edu.au/) and/or perhaps this blog.
- A small amount of activity aimed at performing some design tasks.
- A bit of playing around with various systems and resources.

There won't be any assessment for this one.

### The sessions

I'm planning on having 4 sessions over the 6 hours

1. Introduction  
    Set up who I am and what we're going to be doing. Find out more about the participants - maybe get them to put this on the wiki or perhaps a Wordpress blog -- that sounds like an idea. Introduce the Trigwell (2001) model of university teaching that I'll be using as a basic organising concept. Use it to introduce some of the ideas and explain the aim of the sessions. Introduce them to the technology we'll be using and get them going.
2. The T&L Context  
    Talk about the details of the CQUni T&L context. What tools and resources are available? What do students see when they use various systems (something staff often don't see)? Who to ask for help? etc. Also include mention of "Web 2.0" tools i.e. that the context and tools for T&L aren't limited to what is provided by the institution. Provide an opportunity to play and ask questions about this. Aim is to be concrete, active and get folk aware of what tools they can use. Hopefully to keep them awake after lunch.
3. Teachers' thinking  
    Introduce and "attack" some basic ideas that inform the way people think about learning and teaching. Some ideas about course design, learning and teaching and human cognition.
4. Teachers' planning  
    Talk about the process of actually doing course design and some of the ideas, resources and tools that can be used during this process.

The plan is that the first two would be on the afternoon of the first day with the last two on the following day.

The Trigwell (2001) model of teaching is shown in the following image and is briefly described on the [flickr page](http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/3232493287/) for the image. You should see the connection between the names of the sessions and the model

[![Trigwell's model of teaching](images/3232493287_786abcefd5_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/3232493287/ "Trigwell's model of teaching by David T Jones, on Flickr")

Actually, after posting this I've made some changes to expand the use of the Trigwell (2001) model including teachers' strategies and in particular gathering some of their strategies.

### What's needed? What would be nice?

I want to provide pointers to additional resources and also make use of good resources during the sessions. The [list of what I've got](http://delicious.com/davidj1/foult) is available on [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/).

If you know of any additional resources you'd recommend please either add them in the comments of this post or tag them in del.icio.us with **foult**

Feedback on the above ideas would also be welcome.
