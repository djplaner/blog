Webfuse provides a "staff portal" called Staff MyCQU. It is essentially a web-based application that provides a single interface to most of the tools/services staff require while teaching a course.

### \# staff using the staff portal

The following (as yet incomplete) table shows the # of unique staff using the staff portal and the average number of times each staff member accessed the portal in that year and the total number of requests for the year.

Data for some of the years has not yet been added
