Some progress made this week, but it comes as a prelude to a week in which not much, if anything will be done. This week, after a couple of days at work, the family and I are off to visit Longreach, my sister and her family. We won't get back until after my normal "updates" day. So, I'll miss the updates for next week.

### What I've done

[Last week](/blog2/2009/06/14/phd-update-14-moving-to-a-new-day/) I said that I would

- Complete the process component. - **DONE**
- Make significant progress on the People component. - not even started.

I've just posted the last section of the Process component ([Lessons from process](/blog2/2009/06/21/lessons-from-process-for-university-e-learning/)) and completed the other section earlier in the week ([Learning and teaching processes](/blog2/2009/06/19/learning-and-teaching-processes/)).

### What I'll do next week

As suggested above, it's likely to be bugger all. However, any work I do attempt will be focused on:

- Making some progress on the People component of the Ps Framework.
