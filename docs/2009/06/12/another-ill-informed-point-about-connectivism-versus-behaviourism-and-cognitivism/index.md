In [a previous post](/blog2/2009/06/09/an-ill-informed-observation-on-connectivism-and-other-learning-theories/) I made public one of my half-baked ideas about connectivism. This was sparked by a [similar public considerations](http://damosworld.wordpress.com/2009/05/26/connectivism-and-the-importance-of-context-an-example/) by a [colleague](http://damosworld.wordpress.com/about-damien/).

Another [colleague](http://beerc.wordpress.com/) commented on the apparent connections between aspects of connectivism and the work of [Dave Snowden](http://www.cognitive-edge.com/blogs/dave/). I agree. The following is an excerpt from a talk given by Dave Snowden which I think is connected. Take a listen

[We're pattern matching intelligences - Dave Snowden](http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/PatternsSnowdenLion.mp3)

Do you see any connection between what Dave said in connection with the behavioural and cognitive families of learning theories?

My ill-informed interpretation of this is that these families of learning theories are based on a faulty model of human intelligence.

This isn't to say that in certain circumstances with certain tasks and certain people these learning theories may well provide some useful results. Need to think on this some more.
