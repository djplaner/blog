The main point of this post is to save this quote. I'm about to delete it from the thesis, can't make it fit, and I think it is important.

> (Zellweger 2005) the tasks assigned to each group bear a number of inherent conflicts. For example, the push of instructional designers for creative and flexible solutions matching a faculty memberâ€™s goals might impose a threat for well-rehearsed IT processes. The deviation of standard solutions implicates a certain risk that IT workers would rather avoid as they most of all feel responsible for the stability and security of the IT systems.

It connects with a sentence or two from an [earlier post](/blog2/2009/05/15/institution-another-part-of-place/)

> Ayers (2004) observes that academic and information technology cultures, two of the main sub-cultures involved with e-learning within universities, do not mix together well. The differing viewpoints and subsequently the varying and competing priorities of the different sub-cultures within an organisation can lead to considerable internal tension (Luck, Jones et al. 2004).
