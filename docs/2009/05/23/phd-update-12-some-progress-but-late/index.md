Number 12 of the weekly PhD updates and the first one that is late - this was meant to be done yesterday afternoon. Better late than never. This has been a fairly positive week, some progress made and more importantly I may have learned a small lessons (and put it into practice) about the size and amount of stuff I'm trying to put into these sections of Chapter 2.

I may not get a chance to apply this lessons a great deal in the coming week. Most of it will be spent on a holiday.

### What I did

[Last week](/blog2/2009/05/15/phd-update-11-very-short-week/) I said the aim would be to

- Have completed and posted the section on “Place”. - **DONE**  
    The [last section](/blog2/2009/05/17/lessons-from-place/) was put up fairly early in the week. I'm not all that happy with this section. But it might be close to "good enough".
- Be close to doing the same thing for “Purpose”. - **DONE**  
    This was the major task this week that resulted in [this post](/blog2/2009/05/20/purpose-a-component-of-the-ps-framework/). It's much shorter than the other sections. To some extent this is due to the nature of the component, but mostly my aim not to write another paper for each section.
- Perhaps make some headway for another component of the Ps Framework – perhaps either People or Pedagogy. - started  
    I ended up starting work on the Process component of the Ps Framework. It flowed nicely from Purpose (connection with plan/purpose driven design processes). I've written papers on the question of process, so I have 80+ pages of thoughts and quotes that I'm re-organising into a section. A start has been made.

There have been a few blog posts, somewhat related to the thesis but not worth recounting here.

### What I'll do next week

With most of next week consumed in a holiday, I don't expect to make a great deal of progress. The aim will be to

- Complete the process component, or as much as I can.
