[AUQA](http://www.auqa.edu.au) is coming. Eventually most Australian universities will receive a second visit from AUQA. As such visitations come closer increasing levels of thought are given to demonstrating quality. What does it mean to demonstrate quality of learning and teaching?

According to Biggs (2001) the answer is

> The basic question then for QA is: Are our teaching programmes producing the results we say we want in terms of student learning?

This definition seems to suggest two main questions to answer:

1. What do we say we want in terms of student learning?
2. How do we know if our teaching programmes are producing those results?

Given what [I've had to say](/blog2/2009/03/06/the-biggest-flaw-in-university-lte-learning-and-how-to-avoid-it/) about difficulties associated with measuring the effectivness of learning and teaching, I'm not confident that that the second question can be answered by many universities.

Given that [level 1 smile sheets](/blog2/2009/01/25/somethings-that-are-broken-with-evaluation-of-university-teaching/) do not work what do you do?
