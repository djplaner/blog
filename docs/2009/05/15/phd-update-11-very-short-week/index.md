Well, this week was a very short week. All up 4 days were lost with illness, work and a burst pipe at childcare requiring some additional babysitting duties. That said, I'm feeling pretty happy about the thesis mostly because on major hurdle is out of the way and it went fairly quickly. Hopefully this can continue - the progress, not the short weeks.

### What I've done

[Last week](/blog2/2009/05/08/phd-update-10-dragging-on/) I suggested I would aim to:

- Have completed and posted the section on “Place”.
- Be close to doing the same thing for “Purpose”.
- Perhaps make some headway for another component of the Ps Framework – perhaps either People or Pedagogy.

I haven't really looked at "Purpose" or any other component of the Ps Framework. I've only been able to work on Place. On [last week's summary](/blog2/2009/05/08/phd-update-10-dragging-on/) I outlined the following as sections required to complete "place":

- [Institution](/blog2/2009/05/15/institution-another-part-of-place/) - **DONE**
- Types of systems - **DONE**  
    No post for this section, I've worked it into the institution section in a much reduced form.
- Lessons from place - not done  
    I have much of the structure of what I want to say.

In terms of PhD related blog posts in the last week, I've posted:

- [What don't we (e-)learn](/blog2/2009/05/08/why-dont-we-e-learn-over-emphasis-on-rationality-and-defensive-routines/) relating my introduction to Argyris and Schon's notions of Model 1 and Model 2 behaviours and defensive routines.
- [Everything old is new again](/blog2/2009/05/10/everything-old-is-new-again-universities-should-be-more-business-like/) - sparked by one of the texts I used in the Institution section. It examines how much of the concern shown today about universities, has been going on for sometime.

### What will I do for next week?

I'm going to keep the same aims as for last week:

- Have completed and posted the section on “Place”.
- Be close to doing the same thing for “Purpose”.
- Perhaps make some headway for another component of the Ps Framework – perhaps either People or Pedagogy.
