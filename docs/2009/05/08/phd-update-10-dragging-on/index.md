Well, I've reached double figures for these updates. The last week has been a slow one, or at least felt like it. The public holiday didn't help, nor the day off to [ponder the new position](/blog/2009/05/07/pondering-a-new-position/). Progress has been made, but it just seems slow, especially when compared to what I said I'd do. I'm becoming more used to accepting some progress, be it slow or otherwise, as long as it's moving forward.

### What I've done

[Last week](/blog/2009/05/01/phd-update-9-spluttering-out-of-steam/) I suggested I'd try and

- Have completed and posted the section on “Place” - only partially done.  
    I have completed and posted three parts of this: [the introduction](/blog/2009/05/06/place-component-of-the-ps-framework/), [society](/blog/2009/05/08/society-an-aspect-of-place-impacting-on-e-learning/), and [sector](/blog/2009/05/08/sector-another-part-of-place/).
    
    The remaining sections are:
    
    - Institution  
        The structure is there as is the content. I've started turning it into prose.
    - Types of systems  
        Some content and I know what I want to write - I think. Still needs structure and turned into prose.
    - Lessons from place  
        Most of the content and structure is in place, need to turn it into prose.
- Be close to doing the same thing for “Purpose”. - some minor progress.
- Perhaps make some headway for another component of the Ps Framework – perhaps either People or Pedagogy. - only very minor changes.

The only other PhD associated blog post this week is related to the literature covered in the Place component and the question of whether or not [universities are in crisis and might die](/blog/2009/05/06/university-change-or-die-and-another-problem-with-the-lms-model/). I've connected a perspective on that to the limitations of the LMS model.

### What I'll do for next week

I'm going to stick with last week's aims:

- Have completed and posted the section on “Place”.
- Be close to doing the same thing for “Purpose”.
- Perhaps make some headway for another component of the Ps Framework – perhaps either People or Pedagogy.

Limitations for next week will include the need to spend at least another 2 days thinking about the new position.
