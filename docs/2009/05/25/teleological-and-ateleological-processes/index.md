      content: 'David, interesting post, and interesting process. Regarding process, we
        are looking at learners who are working their problems in public (ideally in public
        communities). Some of our recent thinking can be found here: http://communitylearning.wordpress.com/2009/04/24/harvesting-gradebook-in-the-wild/
    
    
        Don;t let the gradebook word turn you off, we started from conversations about
        grading students, but feedback would be a better term. I think we are looking
        for means to support learners in becoming more effective at ateleological processes.
    
    
        You might also be interested to look at the work of Christopher Alexander, ca
        1980. He is an architect and coined the term "Pattern Language" to describe how
        indigenous peoples developed architecture that had common traits and was adapted
        to local conditions. I think you will recognize these as ateleological architects
        and patterns as tools that experts use to "chunk" their knowledge while working
        in these contexts.'

      content: 'G''day Nils,
    
    
        Thanks for the pointer to your work.  It sounds very interesting and I hope (within
        the constraints of completing the PhD) to follow up on what you''re doing.  I
        think it could be very useful to me.
    
    
        The gradebook word didn''t turn me off.  I read somewhere in the blogosphere recently
        that the only thing Blackboard has of use is the gradebook, and that''s of questionable
        value because of the design.  I work within a university setting so marking, certification
        and accreditation and probably the key tasks and the ones which seem to have the
        least support amongst Web 2.0 tools.  So interesting ways of implementing a gradebook,
        is very interesting.
    
    
        I''m aware of Alexander''s work.  In fact, Introna (1996) uses Alexander as the
        extant example of an ateleological process.  I''ve also done some work of my own
        with patterns back in 1999.  However, I''ve begun to question <a href="https://djon.es/blog/2009/02/22/patterns-for-e-learning-a-lost-opportunity-or-destined-to-fail/"
        rel="nofollow">the value of that sort of work</a>.
    
    
        Essentially, I personally like the idea, however, I''m not sure how good a fit
        it is with the reality of the academics within the context which I work.  Increasingly,
        I''m interested in things that work, rather than things which are theoretically
        interesting.
    
    
        David.'

The following is an early section on the Process component of the [Ps Framework](/blog2/2009/03/18/the-ps-framework/) and is intended as part of chapter 2 of [my thesis](/blog2/research/phd-thesis/). Still fairly rough, but somewhat cleaner than some of the thesis sections I've shared here.

### Teleological and ateleological processes

Clegg (2002) suggests that one of the most pervasive debates in management has been between the "planning school" and the "learning school". The planning/learning school continuum is mirrored in a range of literature describing different approaches to processes. Table 2.1 provides a summary of some of this literature. Table 2.1 and this thesis make use of the terminology introduced by Introna (1996) with respect to design processes: teleological and ateleological. This continuum covers the spectrum of different types of processes identified in the literature on and informing the practice of e-learning within universities.

Table 2.1 - Different authors and terms for the teleological/ateleological continuum
| Author | Teleological | Ateleological |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mintzberg (1989) | Deliberate strategy | Emergent strategy |
| Brews and Hunt (1999)   Clegg (2002) | Planning school | Learning school |
| Seely Brown and Hagel (2005) | Push systems | Pull systems |
| Kutz and Snowden (2007) | Idealistic | Naturalistic |
| Hutchins (1991) | Supervisory reflection and intervention | Local adjustment |
| Truex, Baskerville and Klein (1999) | Traditional information systems design | Emergent information systems design |
| March (1991) | Exploitation | Exploration |
| Boehm and Turner (2003) | Plan-driven | Agile |

Introna (1996) identified eight attributes of a design process and uses them to distinguish between the two extremes: teleological (planning school) and ateleological (learning school). The eight attributes of a design processes are used by Introna (1996) to highlight the differences between the two extremes. This work is summarised in Table 2.2 and will be expanded in the following sections.

Table 2.2 - Attributes of teleological and ateleological design processes (adapted from Introna, 1996)
| Attributes of the design process | Teleological development | Ateleological development |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ultimate purpose | Goal/purpose | Wholeness/harmony |
|   Intermediate goals | Effectiveness/efficiency | Equilibrium/homeostasis |
| Design focus | Ends/result | Means/process |
| Designers | Explicit designer | Member/part |
| Design scope | Part | Whole |
| Design process | Creative problem solving | Local adaptation, reflection and learning |
|   Design problems | Complexity and conflict | Time |
| Design management | Centralized | Decentralized |
| Design control | Direct intervention in line with a master plan | Indirect via rules and regulators |

The information systems discipline has seen fairly widespread domination by teleological thinking and ateleological design taking on a subservient position (Introna 1996). A position reinforced by the labels used by Truex et al (Truex, Baskerville et al. 1999) where teleological design was described as traditional information systems design while ateleological design is labeled emergent information systems design. Introna (1996) suggests that most, if not all, of what happens within modern organizations is teleological. Teleological processes dominate the training and practice of information systems development (Baskerville, Travis et al. 1992). Many, if not most, universities follow, or at least profess to follow, a purpose driven approach – a teleological approach – to setting strategic directions (McConachie, Danaher et al. 2005).

There are risky extremes inherent in both approaches that must be avoided if organizations and systems are to be functional rather than dysfunctional (Jones, Luck et al. 2005). An extreme pre-occupation for either exploration or exploitation can trap organizations in unproductive states (March 1991). A purely deliberative strategy suggests no learning, while a purely emergent strategy suggests no control (Mintzberg 1994). A synthesis of the most productive elements of both teleological and ateleological approaches is crucial to addressing the plethora of issues competing for the attention of university decision-makers (Jones, Luck et al. 2005). The aim of this section is to offer a brief explanation of the two ends of the process continuum and the relevant weaknesses and strengths of the two extremes. The following section (Section 2.1.2) examines the literature around the processes used in universities and, in particular, for e-learning.
