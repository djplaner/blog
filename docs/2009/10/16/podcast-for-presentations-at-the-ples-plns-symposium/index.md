The following basically tells the rationale and approach used to create a [(audio) podcast](http://feeds.feedburner.com/Delicious/davidj1/pleplnpodcast) of the presentations from the [Personal Learning Environments & Personal Learning Networks Online symposium on learning-centric technology](http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/blogs/ples/).

I don't know if anyone else has already done this, but just in case will share.

If you don't want to be bored by the background, [this is the link for the podcast](http://feeds.feedburner.com/Delicious/davidj1/pleplnpodcast).

### Rationale

I've hated the idea of the LMS for quite some time. I even had the chance to briefly [lead a project](http://cddu.cqu.edu.au/index.php/PLEs%40CQUni) looking at investigating how PLEs could be grown and used within a university, at least before the organisational restructure came. In its short life the project produced [a symposium](http://cddu.cqu.edu.au/index.php/Symposium_on_Personal_Learning_Environments_2008), a number of publications, various presentations and a little bit of software.

Due to the background I had some significant interest in the [symposium](http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/blogs/ples/) being organised by [George Siemens](http://www.connectivism.ca/) and [Stephen Downes](http://www.downes.ca/). However, due to other responsibilities, odd times (given my geographical location) for the elluminate presentations and the low speed of my home Internet connection I knew I was unlikely to actively engage. Some of these factors have already prevented my on-going engagement with CCK09.

I probably would have left it there, however, over the last 24 hours two separate folk have mentioned the symposium and almost/sort of guilted me into following up. The one thing I can do at the moment, due to a fitness kick involving a great deal of walking, is listen to mp3s. So, I wanted an easy way to get the mp3s. A podcast sounds ideal for my current practices.

### The podcast

Last night I did a quick google and [found this page](http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/wiki/CCK09_Recordings) that seems to provide a collection of links to video and audio recordings of presentations associated with the [CCK09 course](http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/connectivism/). Including some mp3s from the presentations at the PLEs & PLNs symposium

Rather than download and play silly buggers with iTunes I decided to recreate an approach we used on our [first "Web 2.0 course site"](http://webfuse.cqu.edu.au/Courses/EDED11448/). Using [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/) the students and staff in the course could tag audio/video for inclusion in a podcast created by [Feedburner](http://www.feedburner.com/).

So I followed the same process for these:

- Tagged the mp3 files linked to [from this page](http://ltc.umanitoba.ca/wiki/CCK09_Recordings) with del.icio.us using a ["pleplnPodcast" tag](http://delicious.com/davidj1/pleplnPodcast)
- Used feedburner to [create the podcast](http://feeds.feedburner.com/Delicious/davidj1/pleplnpodcast)
- Subscribed via iTunes, this podcast is now part of all the other podcasts I follow.
- Synced with the iPhone and I'm away.

I just hope now that I have the time to reflect and write about what I listen to.

Thank you Deidre and Maijann for the encouragement to engage with the symposium. Thanks to those organising the symposium and CCK09 for the resources.
