### Summary

I've spent today trawling through various government websites trying to get a handle on the CRC program. Still much to read. Sometime soon will need to start talking with some folk. However, there does seem to be some important tasks to complete. The following is my first crack at such a list:

- Identify a unique aim of the proposed CRC that :
    - Fits with the various research and innovation priorities promulgated by the Federal Government.
    - Is attractive to industry partners (with the broadest possible definition of industry).
    - Fits with the CQUni strategic goals and capabilities.  
        i.e. solves an important problem
    - Fits within the criteria for a CRC, but is different.  
        e.g. mention is made that CRCs can include researchers from all disciplines, including the non-tech/sciences. However, at first glance most existing CRCs seem to be technical/science in focus.
- Identify the researchers@CQU that are going to lead this.  
    I'm wondering if this remains a misunderstanding on my part, does CQU - as the lead institution - need to have the gun researchers or simply provide the organisational/collaborative encouragement.
- Get the CQU folk engaged.
- Identify "good/important" industry partners.  
    One's that have the money, ones that the government think are important.
- Identify the research partners.

### Where it sits

Seems the CRC program comes under the [Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research](http://www.innovation.gov.au/Pages/default.aspx). There's a specific [CRC website](http://www.crc.gov.au/).

Mission/purpose of DIISR is

> The Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research strives as a key priority to encourage the sustainable growth of Australian industries by developing a national innovation system that drives knowledge creation, cutting edge science and research, international competitiveness and greater productivity. The Department is committed to developing policies and delivering programs, in partnership with stakeholders, to provide lasting economic benefits ensuring Australia's competitive future.

### What is a CRC

From the [about page](https://www.crc.gov.au/Information/ShowInformation.aspx?Doc=about_CRCs&key=bulletin-board-information-about-crcs&Heading=About%20CRCs)

> A CRC is an incorporated or unincorporated organisation, formed through collaborative partnerships between publicly funded researchers and end users. CRCs must comprise at least one Australian end-user (either from the private, public or community sector) and one Australian higher education institution (or research institute affiliated with a university).

There are 6 broad CRC sectors: manufacturing technology, information and communication technology, mining and energy, agriculture and rural-based manufacturing, environment, and medical science and technology.

It would appear that the ICT sector is the one most applicable to current ideas here.

#### About

Taken from [powerpoint slides](https://www.crc.gov.au/HTMLDocuments/Documents/PDF/Information%20Session%20Powerpoint%20Presentation%20-%20SR%2012.pdf) for 12th round

- Deliver significant economic, environmental and social benefits
- Address major challenges for end-users
- Through medium to long term collaboration

3 main participants: researchers, government and end users. Meant to include all disciplines - including humanities etc. All participants must contribute either in cash or in-kind. **Participants must match the CRC grant.**

CRC program activities

- Medium to long term research
- Education and training
- SME engagement
- Utilisation of research outputs

No limit on amount of money. Time up to 10 years.

Governance includes a board, mostly independent folk.

Selection rounds are annual

Selection criteria:

- Research
- Results
- Resources

Selection process is annual, last year's dates were

- Late may - selection round opened
- June - information sessions
- 14 August - applications close
- September - Stage 2
- Nov/Dec - Interviews in Canberra
- mid-December - Outcome announced

### CRC Association of Australia

The CRCs have [an association](http://www.crca.asn.au/), purpose

> The CRC Association was established on 1 December 1994, originally to promote the CRC Program while also acting a conduit for information sharing and learning between CRCs. Over time the role has evolved to the extent that today the CRCA is also recognised as the principal non-Government advocate of the CRC Program.

### National research and innovation priorities

Seems there are both research and innovation priorities. The following summarises some points from the proposed [national priorities for innovation](http://www.innovation.gov.au/innovationreview/Documents/NIS_review-chapter11.pdf)

Distinct features of Australia:

- Tyranny of distance
- Low density
- National endowments
- Multicultural diversity
- Size - too small to have others solve the problems for us.

Principles for determining priorities

- Leveraging Australia’s natural endowments or built strengths;
- Areas where there is a distinctively Australian challenge or an advantage in developing solutions to globally relevant challenges or markets;
- Areas where there is scope to transform or reinvent existing industries and service delivery, competitively;
- Internationalising Australia’s innovation system through global integration; and
- Investing in national capabilities, facilities and innovation infrastructure supporting these priorities.

Immediate innovative priorities for government:

- Agricultural and food security. Plant sciences - educating farmers, graziers, outreach...
- Climate change mitigation and adaptation. **Engineering?**
- Population health....**Allied health?**
- Tropical solutions **Align with JCU?**
- Broadband applications **educational technology, basis for the above, how can it change the above??**

**Question:** Has recommendation 11 - i.e national innovation priorities become focus for policy - been accepted.

### Reports to read

DIISR

- Powering ideas: an innovation agenda for the 21st century - [full report](http://www.innovation.gov.au/innovationreview/Documents/PoweringIdeas_fullreport.pdf) and [executive summary](http://www.innovation.gov.au/innovationreview/Documents/PoweringIdeas_executivesummary.pdf) --- actually **just about everything [here](http://www.innovation.gov.au/innovationreview/Pages/home.aspx)**

### Drivers

Department has an emphasis on innovation - **Apply educational technology innovations to regional areas to improve X, Y, Z**

### Misc ideas

The SMART Internet CRC allowed small organisations join as part of an alliance - normally core membership costs upwards of $100K.

CRC for Spatial Information set up an umbrella company that small organisations could join - encouraged to treat the CRC as their research division.
