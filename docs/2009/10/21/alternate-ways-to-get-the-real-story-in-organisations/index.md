I've just been to a meeting with a strangely optimistic group of people who are trying to gather "real stories" about what is going on within an organisation through focus groups. They are attempting to present this information to senior management in an attempt to get them to understand what staff are experiencing, to indicate that something different might need to be done.

We we asked to suggest other things they could be doing. For quite some time I've wanted to apply some of the approaches of [Dave Snowden](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Snowden) to tasks like this. The following mp3 audio is an [excerpt from this recording](http://www.cognitive-edge.com/podcastdetails.php?podid=89) of Dave explaining the results of one approach they have used. I recommend the entire recording or any of the others that are there.

Imagine this type of approach applied to students undertaking courses at a university as a real alternative to flawed smile sheets.
