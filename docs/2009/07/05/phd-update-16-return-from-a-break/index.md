As mentioned [a fortnight ago](/blog2/2009/06/21/phd-update-15-some-progress-and-an-absence/) I've had much of the last two weeks doing non-PhD stuff including a [road trip to Longreach](http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/tags/longreach/). So this update is somewhat light on.

### What I've done

[Last update](/blog2/2009/06/21/phd-update-15-some-progress-and-an-absence/) I said I would by now have:

- Made some progress on the People component of the Ps Framework.

To some extent that's been done. I have a structure and I have completed a draft of the [first major section on Students](/blog2/2009/06/29/students-and-e-learning-a-start-to-the-people-section/). That draft includes an overview of what I think the structure for the People component will be.

I've spent today wondering the literature gathering perspectives on some of the other sections. I have sufficient information on this stuff, I need to write it up. That's next week's job.

### What I'll do next week

There's a trend developing here with weekends. Next weekend I'll be off celebrating a couple of anniversary related events in Adelaide. This means Friday through Tuesday will be lost to the PhD.

In this case, I aim to have another update on the Thursday before I leave. The main aim from now until then will be to:

- Make as much progress as possible on the People component.

I'm hoping to have at least 2 or 3 days writing.
