Received formal institutional approval yesterday to commence the process of porting [BAM](/blog2/research/bam-blog-aggregation-management/) into Moodle. This has two implications that spring to mind:

1. I get to learn a new development environment; and  
    For the last 13-15 years I've been doing my development in Perl. In the last 10 years or so, nice OO perl within a framework of my own devising. Now I have take a step backwards to PHP, and from what little I hear fairly primitive procedural PHP.
    
    I remember having a Perl versus PHP argument through proxy with a "young" developer about 7 or so years ago. I thought PHP was a recipe for horrible code - procedural, mixing HTML and code....uggh. And guess what I'm doing now?
    
2. There's finally a fairly clear project/direction for the [new position](/blog2/2009/08/20/elearning-and-innovation-specialist-report-1-4-20-august)/.

Three of the accountabilities for the [new position](/blog2/2009/08/20/elearning-and-innovation-specialist-report-1-4-20-august)/ include: relationships, communicate and public and continuous improvement. As part of fulfilling these accountabilities I plan to document the process of porting BAM into Moodle on this blog via the [BAM category](/blog2/category/bam/).

It is possible, that as I learn more about Moodle, that the notion of BAM will change significantly in terms of implementation. i.e. BAM may not become a stand alone module. If there are other tools/services within Moodle that can provide the functionality (and I become aware of them), I'll lean towards using them.

The plan is to have this completed in time for it to be used from around mid-February 2010. Hopefully earlier.
