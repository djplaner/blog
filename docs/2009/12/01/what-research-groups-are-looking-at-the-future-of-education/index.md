As outlined very briefly [in a recent post](/blog2/2009/12/01/what-am-i-doing/) I am involved in the early days of project that may result in some sort of proposal for a research group/centre around the future of education. This is meant to be some documentation of my early research to look for groups that are already doing work in this area.

This is still very early days. There's a strong chance that the "direction" will be refined and/or changed. For example, it might become concerned with the future of education within regional areas. It might not. Finding out what others are doing in the area, will help inform any changes.

At the moment, I'm thinking of the following main groups to look for:

1. Australian university research groups.  
    By the nature this idea has to be aware of other groups and be seen to fit/collaborate with them.
2. EC research groups.  
    I have a vague recollection of the EU funding groups/research in this sort of thing.
3. More broadly.  
    In recent months the future of education, especially universities has been getting a bit of airplay within the media. There will be other folk doing work. Obviously there are also university/research groups from outside the EU and Australia. For example, if I google "future of education" it returns 69M+ hits.

Apart from reporting the findings when I search the above, the following also includes "factors". A collection of ideas/thoughts/factors people think either are or will influence the future of education.

If you're not interested in the filtering and summarisation I give below. You can view the [list of resources](http://delicious.com/davidj1/futureofeducation) I look at (but may not include below) on del.icio.us.

This isn't complete. A bit more to do.

### Australian research groups and resources

Australian universities - academic education groups :

- Curtin University - nothing obvious,.
- [Monash](http://www.education.monash.edu.au/) - [group on globalisation](http://www.education.monash.edu.au/research/groups/globalisation/) and [another on Work and Learning Across Boundaries](http://www.education.monash.edu.au/research/groups/worklearning/)

Some [fairly recent, short term insights](http://www.deewr.gov.au/Ministers/Gillard/Media/Releases/Pages/Article_091120_172558.aspx) into where various Australian governments are going.

### EU research groups

All things education and training in the European Commission seems to be able to be found [from here](http://ec.europa.eu/education/index_en.htm).

### More broadly

- [Future of Education](http://www.futureofeducation.com/) - a Ning site. Seems quite active. Good presenters. Ahh, it's an interview series with sponsorship from the [KnowledgeWorks Foundation](http://www.kwfdn.org/).
- [Future of learning](http://www.kwfdn.org/future_of_learning/) - futurist type work from the KnowledgeWorks Foundation. Includes various outputs.
- [Future of Learning](http://www.futureofed.org/) another site arising from the KnowledgeWorks foundation. Builds on earlier work.
    

### Factors

The following list of terms encompass factors which people think will influence the future of education. They include: openness, Web 2.0, "the flat world",

The [map of future forces affecting education](http://www.kwfdn.org/map/) from the KnowledgeWorks Foundation provides a much more detailed outline, including the ability to dive deeper.

This [future of education](http://www.futuristspeaker.com/2007/03/the-future-of-education/) post identifies a range of issues, but I'm somewhat underwhelmed by the conclusions.
