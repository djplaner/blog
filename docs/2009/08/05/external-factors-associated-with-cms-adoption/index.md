This post follows on from [a previous post](/blog2/2009/08/05/factors-related-to-the-breadth-of-use-of-lmsvle-features/) and continues an examination of some papers written by Malikowski and colleagues examining the adoption of features of an LMS/VLE/CMS. This one focuses on the 2006 paper.

### External factors associated with CMS adoption

The abstract of this paper (Malikoski, Thompson and Theis, 2006) is

> Course management systems (CMSs) have become a common resource for resident courses at colleges and universities. Researchers have analyzed which CMS features faculty members use most primarily by asking them which features are used. The study described builds on previous research by counting the number of CMS features a faculty member used and by analyzing how three external factors are related to the use of CMS features. The external factors are (a) the college in which a course was offered, (b) class size, and (c) the level of a class—such as 100 or 200. The only external factor showing a statistically significant relationship to the use of CMS features was the college in which a course was offered. Another finding was that CMSs are primarily used to transmit information to students. Implications are described for using external factors to increase effective use of more complex CMS features.

**Implication: repeat this analysis with the Webfuse and Blackboard courses at CQU** We can do this automatically for a range of external factors beyond those.

#### Point of the research

Echoing what was said in the 2008 paper and one reason I am interesting in this work

> Faculty members often receive help in using a CMS (Arabasz, Pirani, & Fawcett, 2003; Grant, 2004). This help typically comes from professionals who focus on instructional design or technology. Information about which features are used most could provide these professionals with a starting point for promoting effective use of more complex CMS features. Information about how external factors influence use could identify situations in which more complex features can be successfully promoted.

#### Prior research

Points of difference between this research and prior work are listed as:

- Few studies have focused on the use of the CMS in resident courses.
- Generated from surveys.
- Morgan's suggestion that faculty use more features over time may only be partially correct.
- Only one study used a statistical analysis.
- Previous studies analyse usage for all staff or for a broad array of staff - focusing on a few factors might be a contribution.
- Lastly, add to research by including examination of how people learn.
    
    > Currently, research into CMS use has considered CMS features, opinions from teachers about these features, and student satisfaction with CMS features. Gagné, Briggs, and Wager summarize the importance of considering both learning psychology and technology, which they refer to as “media.” They emphasize “the primacy of selecting media based on their effectiveness in supporting the learning process. Every neglect of the consideration of how learning takes place may be expected to result in a weaker procedure and poorer learning results.” (Gagné, Briggs, & Wager, 1992, p. 221). For decades, researchers have studied how teaching methods affect learning outcomes. Several recent publications describe seminal research findings, research that has built on these findings, and learning theories that have emerged from this research (Driscoll, 2005; Gagné et al., 1992; Jonassen & Association for Educational Communications and Technology, 2004; Reigeluth, 1999).
    
    That is as may be. But given my suspicion that most academic don't really make a rational judgements about how they teach based on educational literature - would such an analysis be misleading and pointless?

They argue that the model from Malikowski, Thompson and Theis (2007) is what they use here and that it combines both features and theory and can be used to synthesise research.

#### Methodology

Interestingly, they have a spiel about causation and relationship

> An important point to clarify is that the method applied in this study was not intended to determine if external factors caused the use of CMS features. Identifying causation is an important but particularly challenging research goal (Fraenkel &Wallen, 1990). Instead, the current method and study only sought to determine if significant relationships existed between external factors and the adoption of specific CMS features.

Looks like basically the same methodology and perhaps same data set as the [2008 paper](/blog2/2009/08/05/factors-related-to-the-breadth-of-use-of-lmsvle-features/). They do note some problems with the manual checking of course sites

> This analysis was a labor intensive process of viewing a D2LWeb site for a particular course and completing a copy of the data collection form, by counting how often features in D2L were used. In some cases, members of the research team counted thousands of items.

#### Results

The definition of adoption used is different than that in the 2008 paper

> In this study, a faculty member wasconsidered to have adopted a feature if at least one instance of the feature was present. For example, if a faculty member had one quiz question for students, that faculty member was considered as having adopted the quiz feature

Only 3 of the 13 LMS features available were used by more than half the faculty - grade book, news/announcements, content files. Also the only 3 features where the percentage of adoption was greater than the standard deviation.

**Implication:** A comparison of Webfuse usage using different definitions of adoption could be interesting as part of a way to explore what would make sense as a definition of adoption.

In some cases STDDEV was twice as large as the percentage of faculty members using a feature.

They include the following pie chart that is meant to use the model from Malikowski et al (2007). But I can't, for the life of me, figure out how they get to it.

Found that only the college (discipline) could be said to be the only external factor that was a significant predictor of feature usage.

#### Discussion

Raises the question of norms and traditions within disciplines driving CMS feature adoption. I'm amazed more isn't made of these being residential courses. This might play a role.

**Implication:** It might be argued that norms and tradition are more than just discipline based. I would argue that at CQU, when it comes to online learning that there were three main traditions based on faculty structures from the late 1990s through to early noughties:

1. Business and Law - some courses with AIC students, very different approach to distance education and also online learning. Had a very strong faculty-based set of support folk around L&T and IT.
2. Infocom - similar to Business and Law in terms of AIC courses and distance education. But infected by Webfuse and similar to BusLaw had a strong faculty-based set of support folk around L&T and IT.
3. Others - essentially education, science, engineering and health. Next to no AIC students. Some had no distance education. No strong set of faculty-based support folk around IT and L&T> Though, education did have some.

Would be interesting to follow/investigate these norms and traditions and how that translated to e-learning. Especially since the faculty restructure around 2004/2005 meant there was a mixing of the cultures. BusLaw and large parts of Infocom merged. Parts of Infocom merged with education and arts....

### Limitations

Study involved 81 faculty members as opposed to 862, 730, 192 and 191 in other studies. Argument is that those other studies used surveys, not the more resource intensive approach used by this work.

The recognise the problem with change

> The current study analyzed CMS Web sites when they were on a live server. The limitation in this case is that a faculty member can change a Web site while it is being analyzed. Fortunately, the university at which this study occurred has faculty members create a different CMS Web site each time a course is offered.
