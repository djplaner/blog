This is a story about [serendipitous connectability](http://punya.educ.msu.edu/2009/03/23/serendipitous-connectability-a-short-history-of-an-idea/) connecting both the online and offline worlds and making me aware of a growing narrative or theory. Which makes me question whether or not nudging or [nudge theory](http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/jul/12/economy.conservatives1?gusrc=rss&feed=worldnews) is [libertarian paternalism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_paternalism)

### The connections

At lunch today I was reading the [Australian newspaper](http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/) and came across [this article](http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,25942953-7583,00.html) - "No nudging, please". In which the author refers to something called "nudge theory" as a recent bandwagon and boils nudge theory down to being libertarian paternalism.

While I wasn't aware of the phrase nudge theory, the descriptions of nudge theory did ring some bells

> nudge theory finds individuals often behave in ways that do not conform to the conventional view of the rational economic man

This connects with some of my long term thoughts, [recent reading](/blog2/2009/07/15/predictably-irrational-implications-for-lt-at-universities/) and [recent writings](/blog2/2009/08/16/people-cognition-rationality-and-e-learning/).

This morning, before lunch and before I read the paper, I [posted the first public thoughts](/blog2/2009/08/18/herding-cats-losing-weight-and-how-to-improve-learning-and-teaching/) on a presentation I'm working on that seems to connect here. The presentation is going to argue that most approaches to improving L&T at universities assume techno-rational approaches (herding cats) - or at the least assume that people are rational - and this is why they continue to fail. I was going to argue that better approaches would be based on an environment that encourages small, on-going improvements in practice (weight loss). An [approach informed by complex adaptive systems](/blog2/2009/08/06/loosing-weight-improving-learning-and-teaching-and-complex-systems/) and the observation that people aren't rational (it's still a work in progress.

The idea that this approach could be interpreted as paternalism is somewhat troubling.

Then this afternoon, I'm trying to find some more mp3 recordings of presentations to listen to while walking (part of my personal weight loss program applying similar principles) I came across a post on [choice architecture and education](http://www.gardnercampbell.net/blog1/?p=897) by [Gardner Campbell](http://www.educause.edu/Community/MemDir/Profiles/WGardnerCampbell/47976)

> Aside: I came to Gardner's post via a [Stephen Downes' post](http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=49847) reporting on [Gardner's talk at OpenEd'09](http://www.ustream.tv/recorded/1978748). Anyone have an mp3 of the video? Perhaps I should learn how/if ustream videos can be converted into mp3s.

Garnder's post reports on his initial thoughts of the book [Nudge: Improving decisions about health, wealth and happiness](http://www.amazon.com/Nudge-Improving-Decisions-Health-Happiness/dp/014311526X/ref=bxgy_cc_b_text_b). Reading the Amazon page suggests that the book and the theory very much brings together the ideas I've been thinking about. But I still find the question of paternalism somewhat troubling.

It's a point that Gardner picks up on in his post

> Although their advocacy of “libertarian paternalism” probably won’t please either the rigid high-stakes testers or the unschoolers, it does (so far) offer in my view a very interesting model for education that takes into account the need for expert understanding and guidance of the developing learner

Does my initial concern make me a rigid high-stakes tester or a unschooler?

### Why am I troubled? Should I be troubled?

One of contentions is that much of the current attempts at improving learning and teaching within universities and how they are implemented are very paternalistic. I phrase it as [level 2 approaches](/blog2/2009/02/26/improving-university-teaching-learning-from-constructive-alignment-by-not-mandating-it/#3levels) to learning and teaching. It is my belief that these approaches get in the way and actively reduce the chance of improving learning and teaching.

This is a flaw I'm seeking to address. So any chance that I'm also be paternalistic, strikes a nerve.

I have to admit that my initial reaction to the Australian newspaper article was moderated somewhat when I saw the byline of the author

> Julie Novak is a research fellow with the Institute of Public Affairs.

The [Institute of Public Affairs](http://www.ipa.org.au/) bills itself as "Australia's leading free market think tank" and has a tag line "free people, free society". So they probably fit in Gardner's "unschooler" category.

Also, I believe that Professor [Michael Sandel's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Sandel) [Reith Lectures for 2009](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lb6bt) titled "A new politics of the common good" do a pretty good job - from my perspective - of arguing that the application of only free market principles to education has some flaws. In fact, I'm pretty happy that this perspective provides a reasonable arguent against the "unschoolers".

At the other end of the spectrum - "the rigid high-stakes tester" - in my context equates to the top-down managerialists and the [the technologists alliance](/blog2/2009/01/21/why-am-i-a-eportfolio-skeptic/#alliance). The folk who think there is a single idea (or maybe a few) that will radically improve L&T and that if only we can get those silly academics to adopt this approach, then everything will be alright. Just about anyone from a systems background (Senge etc) fit into this group as well. As long as we all have the same values, we'll be okay.

To me this people are strong paternalists. They've come up with the solution. We will do as we're told. Only we don't. We're irrational, we're different and we have agency. We will fight back. So the whole thing disolves into tension and conflict.

While the underpinnings of the [nascent approach](/blog2/2009/02/26/improving-university-teaching-learning-from-constructive-alignment-by-not-mandating-it/#alignment) I'm trying to develop and communicate draw on aspects of nudge theory (I have to read more to find out just exactly how much) it's not the core. The core of the idea is that the environment that support L&T at a university has to have appropriate features that continue and enable academics to reflect and change their practice. And that this approach should be based on what we know about human cognition and rationality, i.e. that we're not.

So, rather than applying "nudge theory" to encourage academics to adopt "good approaches to L&T" that I, or anyone else, has identified. The aim is to apply aspects of nudge theory to encourage academics to reflect and support them in identifying improvements to L&T that work for them in a sustainable way.

But then, when is all said and done, organisations always have limited resources there will, at some stage, need to be decisions made. Is this where management steps in? Novak makes the following point in her Australian article

> The notion that the state should nudge individuals to make better decisions overlooks the fact politicians and government officials are also afflicted by behavioural biases.

. It is important that when management do end up making decisions, that they also be aware of their limitations. That they are also nudged in the right direction.

More thinking to be done.
