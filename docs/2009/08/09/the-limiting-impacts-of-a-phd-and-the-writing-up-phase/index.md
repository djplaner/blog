The following is part reflection, part admission and mostly a warning and explanation to those that might care. Over the last few months, I've been spending a fair amount of time working on my thesis. As part of that I have attempted to ignore any number of things and limit my interests. Consequently, any number of social relationships have been let slide, not to mention reading and keeping up with things outside of the PhD (e.g. blogs of other folk).

This has possibly been a boon to some and maybe a problem for others. To a large extent, I'm the one most effected by it in terms of missed opportunities and perspectives. But you can't have everything and the PhD has been waiting for a long time.

In the last few days, however, I've come to realise that I've been taking it to easy. I haven't really taken finishing the PhD as seriously as perhaps I should. That's about to change. I need to cut back further and focus more. Time to become a real PhD hermit.

So, please understand if you don't see or hear from me. I apologise up front for the weakening of the social ties and not contributing as much as perhaps I should, but completing the PhD is becoming very important.
