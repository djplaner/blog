There is a definition of insanity that I've seen seen attributed to either Einstein or Benjamin Franklin,

> â€œThe definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results"

That quote, at least for me, has connections with one of more certain origins.

> Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.

which comes from [George Santayana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Santayana)

### The connection with LMSes and e-learning

There is an orthodoxy in e-learning at universities. Implement a learning management system like Blackboard, Moodle, Sakai.... Different names, slightly different features but essentially the same type of tool. A big integrated "ring to rule them all".

At least going by the literature I read and the experience I have the success of LMSes has been far from good. Either the LMS is rarely used or what use it is put to is at a very low level in terms of quality learning and teaching.

Given this is known, then why are many universities up to their second, third and even fourth learning management system? Why are they doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results?

### My answer

In the following presentation I give my answer, which is essentially

- Implementation of e-learning is really complex and requires a mix of skills and knowledge.
- It's easier to adopt a fad - the LMS - than engage with the complexity.

To some extent, this might have some connection with the idea of [task corruption](/blog2/2009/03/04/task-corruption-in-teaching-university-negative-impact-of-place/).

### Those who disagree with the definition of insanity

There is not universal agreement on the validity or source of the "Einstein" quote. [George Sanger](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/au/2203) has a post titled ["The definition of Insanity is, perhaps, using that quote"](http://blogs.oreilly.com/digitalmedia/2006/10/the-definition-of-insanity-is.html). Of course, I and a number of the folk commenting on the post disagree.

One of the most credible seeming points made against this quote is

> It contradicts the notions of experimentation and practice.

Which, on reflection, doesn't apply. For me at least, experimentation and practice, means that you will **not** be doing the same thing again and again. You will be trying slightly different things. Each time you practice you will be working to improve what you are doing, to learn from your mistakes.

### The source of the insanity quote

[Wikiquote](http://en.wikiquote.org/) attributes the insanity quote to [Rita Mae Brown](http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Rita_Mae_Brown) and her book ["Sudden Death"](http://www.amazon.com/Sudden-Death-Rita-Mae-Brown/dp/0553269305/ref=pd_bbs_7?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1236124407&sr=8-7)
