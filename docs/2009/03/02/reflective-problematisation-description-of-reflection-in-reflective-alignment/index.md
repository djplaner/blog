title: Reflective problematisation - description of reflection in "reflective alignment"?
type: post
template: blog-post.html

Thinking about [reflective alignment](/blog/2009/02/26/improving-university-teaching-learning-from-constructive-alignment-by-not-mandating-it/), I came across the following quote in Booth and Anderberg (2005). Thought it might be useful so am saving it here.

> the equally important notion of reflective problematization - deliberately distancing oneself from the familiar, deliberately avoiding the taken-for-granted and considering the alternatives that might be at hand, relating to theories and experience and reaching an analytical insight into productive change.

The connection with "reflective alignment" is that this is a pretty good description of the type of reflection which I observe in the "good" teachers. It's the type of reflection "reflective alignment" would seek to encourage and enable.
