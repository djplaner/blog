      content: 'Hi, David,
    
    
        I strongly disagree with your claim: ''Any form of technology will not improve
        learning and teaching.''  However, you ARE writing within that closed empire of
        University life which is a very minimal part of the whole learning spectrum -
        by my calculations 10% x 5% x5% of all learners.
    
    
        Teaching (and the necessity of learning) might still be considered as a 9-4 job
        in Universities but certainly not in schools, Adult Learning, Distanc Learning
        etc.  The Technology  *has* already changed the way teachers and students communicate,
        when they choose to work and how assessment of learning is managed.
    
    
        Significantly, through the e-Portfolio, formative assessments are now being demanded
        with very fast turn-arounds.   e-Portfolios also generate a pride of ownership
        which no school exercise book ever possessed.
    
    
        I accept that from your experience many of the things that you say may be true.  However,
        in the politest possibly way, I would suggest that it is sad that your thinking
        on e-Portfolios has been coloured by the massive disinformation machine of Higher
        Education.
    
    
        Who, in their right mind would foist PebblePad or Mahara on a five-year old, the
        disabled, an elderly person or the slow learner?  Have a look at some of the links
        in my eFolio or my blog for alternatives to the closed-box mentality of University
        life ;-)

      content: 'G''day Ray,
    
    
        Thanks for the dissenting comment.  Always good to have a reality check.
    
    
        I take your point about the relative "smallness" of higher ed, but it is where
        I work, so it''s my focus.
    
    
        I guess the title of my post should actually "Technology alone will *not*...."
        and that is what I''m railing against in the post. The tendency that I regularly
        see that assumes the the simple introduction of a new technology will change teaching.  The
        additional of new technology can certain enable change, but on its own it will
        not ensure that change happens. Perhaps in my reaction to that, I''ve over extended
        the rhetorical device.
    
    
        Has this been your experience?  Has the simple addition of eportfolios changed
        the way people in other sectors (e.g. schools) teach?  Or have there been other
        factors?
    
    
        In the "skeptic" post, I mention the "technologists alliance", I would suggest
        the the presence of a new technology will quickly be adopted and used effectively
        by many of the folk in the innovators/early adopters category.  I''m guessing
        that these are the folk that have written about the use of eportfolios within
        higher education.
    
    
        I''m also guessing/extrapolating that the technology hasn''t fundamentally changed
        the practice of teaching of many of these folk.  Most of them probably already
        had a view of teaching and learning that exhibited many of the positive characteristics
        of teaching approaches that eportfolios support.  The new tool has just let them
        do it in a slightly better way.
    
    
        I''ve got another post coming in which I''ll expand on this.
    
    
        So, at this stage, you haven''t changed my mind. But you have reminded me not
        to get too close minded.
    
    
        Thanks.
    
    
        David.'

      content: 'Yes, the technology by itself will not change anything as far as I can
        see.  The classic example is the introduction of the introduction of the OHP that
        only imitated the presentations using an epidiascope or latterly the introduction
        of the IWB which only imitated the more sterile use of the OHP - with no interactivity!
    
    
        I also agree that introducing the e-Portfolio as a purely sterile but electronic
        version  of the ''shoebox'' or manilla envelope portfolio does nothing to change
        teaching and learning.  However, where teachers are keen to develop learner-centric
        strategies and can cope with the electronic demands of instant satisfaction the
        e-Portfolio can become a most powerful tool.
    
    
        I would argue that for me the e-Portfolio has been a liberating experience.  Please

        I''m hoping to take up this conversation more in a later post on my blog.  Much
        more to say, not enough time not space in the comments.
    
    
        Based on your comments above, I don''t think there is a great deal of distance
        between our views.
    
    
        I do want to take up the point about good/bad craftsmen.  I''ve used the quote
        often myself, but I think it also hides some troubling assumptions that prevent
        useful engagement with the problem.

I'm currently working on chapter 2 of [my thesis](/blog2/research/phd-thesis/), which is an explication of some of what is known about "e-learning" through the lens of the Ps Framework.

Last night I posted a [draft of the section of the chapter](/blog2/2009/03/18/the-ps-framework/) that introduces the Ps Framework. Today, I've been working on getting a first draft of the "Past Experience" section of the chapter onto the blog.

I've already mined some of this work for [a previous post](/blog2/2009/03/15/comparing-vleslms-to-the-past-flaws-and-implications-for-development-models/) about how the lessons of the past can inform the present. That post even used the "doomed to repeat" quote.

Today, I've come across a new quote, specifically about the learning technology field that was going to serve as a basis for this post. Then, as fate would have it, (pause for breath) I came across [this post](http://www.elearnspace.org/blog/2009/03/18/e-portfolios-3/) from George Siemens, which mentions [article](http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/3668/electronic-portfolios-a-path-to-the-future-of-learning) in "The Wired Campus", which in turn references [this essay](http://www.academiccommons.org/commons/essay/making-common-cause-electronic-portfolios) from the current issue of [Academic Commons](http://www.academiccommons.org/).

The topic is e-portfolios. Something of which I am a [self-confessed skeptic](/blog2/2009/01/21/why-am-i-a-eportfolio-skeptic/).

In this post I'm going to try to justify a link between the comments in the [article](http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/3668/electronic-portfolios-a-path-to-the-future-of-learning) from "The Wired Campus" and an important lesson that we haven't learned from history. In particular, I'd like to create another couple of data points to support this claim from Oliver (2003)

> Learning technology often seems an amnesiac field

### What's claimed for e-portfolios

The [article](http://chronicle.com/wiredcampus/article/3668/electronic-portfolios-a-path-to-the-future-of-learning) from "The Wired Campus" starts of with the claim

> If we truly want to advance from a focus on teaching to a focus on student learning, then a strategy involving something like electronic student portfolios, or ePortfolios, is essential.

The article ends with

> At the moment, ePortfolios represent perhaps the most promising strategy for responding to calls for accountability and at the same time nurturing a culture of experimentation with new forms of learning.

In between it suggests four fundamental features of ePortfolios:

1. Integrate student learning in an expanded range of media, literacies and viable intellectual work.
2. Enable students to link together diverse parts of their learning including the formal and informal curriculum.
3. Engage students with their learning.
4. Offer colleges a meaningful mechanism for accessing and organising the evidence of student learning.

Wow! The solution has been found

### What's been forgotten?

Zemsky and Massey (2004) claim

> One of the more hopeful assumptions guiding the push for e-learning was the belief that the use of electronic technologies would force a change in how university students are taught.

Along similar lines, Littlejohn and Peacock (2003) say

> There was, in many, a false assumption that exposure to computers and CAL packages was sufficient to drive the development of new forms of teaching with technology

Conole (2003) weighs in from a different track, but still somewhat related (at least in my PhD ravaged mind - my emphasis added)

> Politics is a very strong theme that runs across all learning technology research. This in part relates to the over hyping which occurs, **leading to an over expectation of what is possible**. It is also partly due to different local agendas and associated in-fighting as well as the major impact that technologies can have.

One example of this over-hyping is Suppes (1966) - a Stanford professor writing in Scientific American in the 60s about computer-assisted learning.

> the processing and the uses of information are undergoing an unprecedented technological revolution......One can predict that in a few more years millions of school-children will have access to what Philip of Macedon's son Alexander enjoyed as a royal prerogative: the personal services of a tutor as well-informed and responsive as Aristotle.

Well, it's 43 years later, have you got your personal Aristotle?

Do you get any sense that this has a connection with what's happening with e-portfolios (or in some contexts open source learning management systems) at the moment?

### How do you change teaching?

I don't think technology is going to change teaching. If anything the history of e-learning (and other innovations) offer strong evidence that new technology will get used as "horseless carriages". Doing the old stuff, with the new tools.

If you want to change teaching, and subsequently student learning, I currently ascribe to some of the work of Trigwell (2001) (and others) as represented by the following figure. i.e. if you want to change teaching, you have to change the strategies used by teachers.

Zemsky and Massey (2004) again

> Elearning will become pervasive only when faculty change how they teach—not before.

I believe the same applies for e-portfolios.

[![Trigwell's model of teaching](images/3232493287_786abcefd5_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/3232493287/ "Trigwell's model of teaching by David T Jones, on Flickr")

At best, a new technology will offer a small change in the outer onion skin in the above figure. The teaching and learning context. A new technology, like eportfolios, with some affordances that actively support better teaching strategies will certainly make it possible for teaching to change. I just don't think the addition of a new technology will make it likely (or certain) that teaching will change.

There are too many other complicating factors within the teaching and learning context (I'm assuming a university context) that are likely to overwhelm the addition of the new technology. Not too mention the complexity of the interactions between the changes in teaching and learning context and all the other onion skins. For example, the change in teaching will, to some extent, rely on students seeing the value in the change and adapting to it. This is not always a given.

### Why do we continue to focus on the technology?

(Where I'm definining technology as more than just the eportfolio system. But also all the learning designs and other resources that exist to help staff to use the system.)

Back to Littlejohn and Peacock (2003)

> This is because technological issues have in the main been easier to solve than the more complex, social, cultural and organisational issues involved in mainstreaming technology in learning and teaching.

It's easy to introduce an e-portfolio system and offer training sessions in how to use it. This is all an example of "level 2" knowledge about how to improve learning and teaching (see [this post introducing reflective alignment](/blog2/2009/02/26/improving-university-teaching-learning-from-constructive-alignment-by-not-mandating-it/)) .

One of the related reasons (at least for me) is the "technologists alliance" (Geoghegan, 2004) that is talked about in my [original comments on eportfolios](/blog2/2009/01/21/why-am-i-a-eportfolio-skeptic/).

### Conclusions

Any form of technology will not improve learning and teaching. Actually, I think the authors of the Wired Campus article and most of the people who will read this, will know this. So am I simply creating a strawman argument? Am I simply stating the obvious?

The reason I bother in pointing out the obvious, is that I continue to see this happening in universities. It's happening in my current university right now. While the folk that are deeply into learning technology understand that technology will not change learning and teaching. Many of the folk that take on the task of improving learning and teaching use this rhetoric to justify their task. In many cases, some of these folk do believe it.

For example, I'd love to do a survey of all the universities in the world and find out how many started the process of adopting an e-portfolio after someone in the institution's senior leadership read the Wired Campus article or the Academic Commons paper on eportfolios and thought that sounded like a really good. Regardless of the current state or requirements of the local institution. And, almost certainly without a detailed knowledge of the factors at play in the Trigwell figure above.
