It's amazing at how perspectives around technology and its use in education don't change. In the presentation on [this page](http://coursedesign.wordpress.com/thinking/) I use some quotes from [the what if presentation](http://thefischbowl.blogspot.com/2006/09/what-if.html) by Karl Fisch to outline some previous fearful perspectives on the impact of technology on learning that mirror many of the perspectives held of e-learning.

The following couple of quotes illustrate that the positive perspectives of technology can also be found in history.

> Both the processing and the uses of information are undergoing an unprecedented technological revolution... This is perhaps nowhere truer than in the field of education. Once can perdict that in a few more years millions of schoolchildren will have access to what Philip of Macedn's son Alexander enjoyed as a royal perogative: the services of a tutor as well-informed and as responsive as Aristotle.

\-- [Patrick Suppes](http://suppes-corpus.stanford.edu/), "[The Uses of Computers in Education.](http://suppes-corpus.stanford.edu/articles/comped/67.pdf)" - 1966, Scientific Amercian

> The world has arrived at an age of cheap complex devices of great reliability: and something is bound to come of it.
