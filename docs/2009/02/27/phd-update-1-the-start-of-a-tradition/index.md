[![Tradition](images/1398253651_895fc9cc34_m_d.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/ionushi/1398253651/)

In attempt to encourage on-going work and solve the problem of keeping various folk updated I'm going to start a new Friday tradition - posting a summary of the PhD related work I did in the last week. Here's to the first of many.

### 20th to 27th February

In the last week I've

- Given a presentation on the thesis at [the ANU](http://www.anu.edu.au/)
- Caught up on some literature on higher education.
- Had a related paper accepted at an international conference.
- Created a to do list/overview of the thesis.
- Given some thought to the [research note](/blog/2008/10/09/the-anatomy-of-a-design-science-paper-a-research-note/) describing how to write up information systems design research work.

I close with what I currently think I'll aim for next week.

### Presentation

129 slides in 30 minutes, given, recorded and [placed onto slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/davidj/an-information-systems-design-theory-for-elearning) and turned into a slidecast. In the last week, the slidecast has just gone past the 100 views.

### Literature on higher education

For some reason, earlier in the week I ended up looking at the online archives of the journal [Higher Education](http://www.springer.com/education/higher+education/journal/10734). Found a number of papers of interest, both to the PhD and other work.

I've incorporate the work of a number of these papers into Chapter 2. I've found this much easier now that I have a firm grasp on the Ps Framework. Having that structure makes it much easier (but not straight forward) to build the argument.

What I've been reading has also led to a couple of blog posts. Some of these have been trying to get arguments for the thesis down in to prose.

### To do list

Today I've achieve the major thing I wanted to do this week. Get some overall idea of where the thesis is up to, what its structure is and what is left to do. The to do list serves this purpose. I hope to keep this updated, both adding and striking out, to dos as time progresses.

### Presenting design research work

Originally, the submission to JAIS of [Gregor and Jones (2007)](http://aisel.aisnet.org/jais/vol8/iss5/1/) included an appendix that offered a suggested structure for a design theory/research thesis/paper. They didn't want to publish the appendix so we put it [online](/blog/2008/10/09/the-anatomy-of-a-design-science-paper-a-research-note/) a couple of months ago.

At least one of us is keen to get this published. Today I blogged [another post](/blog/2009/02/27/why-formulaic-guidance-annoys-experts-and-why-they-ignore-the-needs-of-the-novice/) providing a potential argument about why the research note is important, even though "experts" will think it problematic.

### Next week

For the foreseeable future (a few weeks at least) I think my major aim will be two fold:

1. Make significant progress, if not complete a draft of Chapter 2 on the Ps Framework.
2. Similar progress on Chapter 3 - especially because I want to get feedback on the ideas I currently have, which may prove to be novel and consequently somewhat limited.
