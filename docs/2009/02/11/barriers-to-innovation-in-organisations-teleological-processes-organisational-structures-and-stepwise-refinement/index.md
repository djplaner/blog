This video speaks to me on so many levels. It summarises many of the problems I have faced and encountered trying to implement innovative approaches to e-learning at universities over the last 15 plus year. I'm sure I am not alone.

Today, I've spent a lot of time not directly related to what I wanted to achieve. Consequently, I had planned not to do or look at anything else until I'd finished. But this video resonates so strongly that I couldn't resist watching, downloading it and blogging it.

I came across the video from [a post by Punya Mishra](http://punya.educ.msu.edu/2009/02/10/barriers-to-innovation-inclusion/). Some more on this after the video. I should also link [to the blog post](http://www.opennasa.com/2009/01/28/barriers-to-innovation-and-inclusion/) on the OpenNASA site. Would your University/organisation produce something similar?

If [Nona](http://nonamuldoon.wordpress.com/) ever gets around to watching this video, I am sure she will see me in a slightly different role in the video. Until recently I had the misfortune to be in the naysayer role. That's no longer the case. Who said no good could come of organisational restructures?

### The benefits of being open

Coming across this video, provides further evidence to support an [earlier post](/blog/2009/02/11/the-value-of-being-open/) I made today on the values of being open. I became aware of Punya's post because of the following process:

- Almost a year ago Punya [published this post](http://punya.educ.msu.edu/2008/03/18/site-2008-keynote/) on his blog that openly shares the video of a keynote he and Mat Koehler gave.
- I came across it not long afterwards through my interest in [TPACK](http://www.tpck.org/) (formerly known as TPCK).
- About two weeks ago I decided to use part of the video in some [sessions](http://coursedesign.wordpress.com/) I was running on course analysis and design.
- A couple of days ago I blogged on an important part of the presentation (not used in the sessions I ran) that resonated with my PhD work.
- My blog software told Punya's blog software about my post and added it as a [comment to his blog](http://punya.educ.msu.edu/2008/03/18/site-2008-keynote/#comment-29919).
- This afternoon [Google Alerts](http://punya.educ.msu.edu/2009/02/10/barriers-to-innovation-inclusion/) sent me an email that [this page](http://punya.educ.msu.edu/2009/02/10/barriers-to-innovation-inclusion/) on Punya's blog was linking to my blog (because of the comment - see the comments section in the right hand menu).
- Out of interest (some might say in the interest of procrastination) I followed the link and saw the video.

I plan to use parts of this video in future presentations around my PhD research. I believe it will resonate with people so much better than me simply describing the abstract principles.

So while not directly contributing to what I wanted to do today. It's provided with a great advantage in the future.

of a Google Alert I have set on my site. Google emailed me to say that Punya had made this post because his blog software includes a list of the

I've spent a lot of time today doing stuff not necessarily directly related to what I wanted to achieve today. To such an extent I'd decided not to blog anymore.
