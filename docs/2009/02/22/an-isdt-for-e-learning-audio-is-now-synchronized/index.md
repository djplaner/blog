On Friday the 20th of Feb I gave a talk at [the ANU](http://www.anu.edu.au/) on my [PhD](/blog2/research/phd-thesis/). A [previous post](/blog2/2009/02/21/an-information-systems-design-theory-for-e-learning/) has some background and an overview of the presentation.

I recorded the presentation using my iPhone and [the Happy Talk recorder application](http://appliedvoices.com/HappyTalk_Product_Site/HT_Professional_Recorder.html). I've finally got the audio up and synchronised with the [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/) presentation.

Hopefully the presentation is embedded below, but I've had some problem embedding it in the blog (all the other slideshare presentations have been ok.

Nope, the embedding doesn't want to work. Bugger. Here's [a link to the presentation page](http://www.slideshare.net/davidj/an-information-systems-design-theory-for-elearning) on Slideshare.

### Limitations of Slideshare

In this presentation, along with most of my current presentations, I use an adapted form of the ["Lessig" method of presentation](http://presentationzen.blogs.com/presentationzen/2005/10/the_lessig_meth.html). A feature of this method is a large number of slides (in my case 129 slides for a 30 minute presentation) with some of the slides being used for very small time frames - some less than a second.

The [Slideshare](http://slideshare.net/) synchronisation tool appears to have a minimum time allowed for each slide - about 15 seconds. At least that is what I found with this presentation. I think perhaps the limitation is due to the interface, or possibly my inability to use it appropriately.

This limitation means that some of the slides in my talk are not exactly synchronised with the audio.

### The Happy Talk Recorder

I'm very happy with it. The quality of the audio is surprisingly good. Little or no problems in using it. I think I will use it more.
