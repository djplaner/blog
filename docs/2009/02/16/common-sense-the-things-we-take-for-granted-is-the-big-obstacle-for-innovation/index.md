[Wesley Fryer](http://www.wesfryer.com/bio/) has a [post](http://www.speedofcreativity.org/2009/02/15/sir-ken-robinson-on-creativity-and-transforming-our-schools-itsc-2009/) summarising a talk given by [Sir Ken Robinson](http://www.sirkenrobinson.com/).

When you consider much of higher education is importing practices from manufacturing...
