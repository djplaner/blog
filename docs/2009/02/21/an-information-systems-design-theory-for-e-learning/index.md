Yesterday I gave a presentation at [the Australian National University](http://www.anu.edu.au/) on my [PhD](/blog2/research/phd-thesis/). I'm doing it through ANU and this 30 minute presentation is a standard requirement of study. The slides are up on [slideshare](http://slideshare.net/) (embedded below). I recorded the audio and will be trying to put that online later on today and make the slides into a slidecast.

### The presentation

!!! warning "Slideshare presentations no longer available"

It appears embedding the presentation in this post isn't working at the moment. The slides can be [found here](http://www.slideshare.net/davidj/an-information-systems-design-theory-for-elearning) on slideshare. -- seems the embedding is working now.

### The description

It's been a while since I worked directly on the PhD and creating this presentation was a way to become deeply familiar with the thesis again, in preparation for writing it up. So the presentation is structured in line with the thesis and provides a high level overview of the whole thing.

While the information systems design theory (ISDT) that is the main product of the thesis gets a mention, explaining the design theory is not the primary goal of the presentation. Such descriptions have been given in other papers ([Jones and Gregor, 2002](https://djon.es/Publications/isdt.pdf); [Jones and Gregor, 2004](/blog2/publications/the-formulation-of-an-isdt-for-e-learning/)). Instead the emphasis of the presentation is on the other components of the thesis that are in need of some extra work.

Most of the content of the presentation is focused on chapter 2 and the [Ps Framework](/blog2/2009/02/16/frameworks-and-representation-tidy-versus-messy/). In fact, must of it is related around the [content of a paper](/blog2/2009/02/15/alternatives-for-the-institutional-implementation-of-e-learning-lessons-from-13-years-of-webfuse/) I've proposed for later in the year.

Essentially the idea is that the practice of e-learning within universities has a definite orthodoxy (which LMS will we adopt). I suggest that for a number of reasons the understandings that underpin that orthodoxy are entirely inappropriate and this is why most university e-learning implementations are plagued by less than widespread use by academics, low quality learning by those that do use it and some concerns around return on investment.

There's also some early work on the structure of chapter 3 - the research method. But still early days there.
