A lot of what I do could be seen as [innovation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation). In the past I was a "faculty teaching and learning innovation officer" and I may well take on such a role in the future. Today, I came across the following quote from [Douglas Adams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_adams) which seems connected to the idea of innovation.

> It is a rare mind indeed that can render the hitherto non-existent blindingly obvious. The cry 'I could have thought of that' is a very popular and misleading one, for the fact is that they didn't, and a very significant and revealing fact it is too.
