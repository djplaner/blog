        We have tried mapping aspects of nursing across the curriculum; aspects that need
        to be built across a period of time and that relate to a range of settings in
        which nursing occurs, as opposed to stuffing the whole thing into one course.
        Literacy and information literacy was one area (generic), and wound management
        (content specific) was the other. The problem we found was that while we could
        do this as an academic exercise, without the absolute support of all academics
        (which we were not able to achieve), the whole thing fell apart. On paper it worked,
        but in practice I think this would require the commitment of all who teach into
        the program. That can sometimes be more difficult than doing the mapping itself.
    
    
        I wrote a paper about the mapping of wound management and found there were a couple
        of very different approaches to this idea - only one seemed to employ technology
        and that tended to be retrospective. To my way of thinking that is a bit like
        closing the gate after the horse has bolted and that mapping is more significant
        in the planning stage of the curriculum to make sure the required content is covered
        across all the courses in the program, but I guess that all depends on why you
        are mapping in the first place.
    
    
        Cheers

      content: 'G''day Wendy,
    
    
        If current projects come to fruition, I''d like to catch up with you and learn
        from your experience.
    
    
        I think you''re right about getting support from all academics.  The technical
        task of doing curriculum mapping - whatever that might be - is a fairly trivial
        exercise when compared with the task of getting everyone to engage effectively.
        IMHO.

      content: 'Hi David,
    
    
        I attended your herding cats talk this morning and you are so right about the
        approach that has been taken in the past (? continues to be taken). This is why
        things like curriculum mapping have been problematic because not everyone has
        been on the same page or had the same goals. I definitely don''t think you are
        a popo! A critical thinker, yes; and uncompromising mirror, yes (don''t you just
        hate mirrors when you are carrying a couple of extra kilos!), but negative, no.
        Please let me know when you have cracked the engagement case because I feel like
        I''ve been hitting my head against that one for some time now and have the bruises
        to prove it. Seriously, though, it is absolutely refreshing to hear someone else
        is on th same planet, and you may not have offered any solutions, but you sure
        as hell have defined the problem far better than I could have done.
    
    
        Thanks
    
    
        Wendy'

        Thanks for the comments.  I share and feel your pain re: mirrors.
    
    
        As for the engagement thing, I''m hoping/can only follow my own advice continuous
        change within the confines the context places.  There are a couple of projects
        that might move this way - but it''s early days and it''s difficult.
    
    
        I do hope to engage in a lot of conversation with people, as much as possible.
    
    
        David.'

A long-running problem at my institution - I don't think we're alone, I think most universities are in this boat - has been the absence of any support or processes around curriculum mapping. I've written [briefly about this before](/blog/2009/08/17/moodle-curriculum-mapping-task-fit-and-task-corruption/), but now I have to produce a report with some background and recommendations.

The following is an attempt to ask questions and see if anyone can provide some additional insights. The following is based on the little bit of searching I've done so far.

### The questions

Some of the questions I have:

- Is curriculum mapping a good idea?
- Has anyone been able to do it with a large group of university academics in a way that is embedded into the group i.e. it's long-term and sustainable? How?
- What's the good literature in this area?
- What tools are people using?
- Is anyone [going bottom up rather than top-down](/blog/2009/08/17/moodle-curriculum-mapping-task-fit-and-task-corruption/)?

### Some definitions

I like this definition of curriculum

> a sophisticated blend of educational strategies, course content, learning outcomes, educational experiences, assessment, the educational environment and the individual studentsâ€™ learning style, personal timetable and programme of work (Harden 2001).

For curriculum mapping this definition works for me so far (same source)

> Curriculum mapping is a spatial representation of the different components of the curriculum so that the whole picture and the relationships and connections between their parts are easily seen. (Harden 2001)

The literature is full of reasons about why this is a good thing, for me the representation of the curriculum - as a whole or various perspectives - provides a tool to enable analysis, disussion and reflection by the full spectrum of management, teachers, support staff, students and others.

### Who's done what?

Most of the work seems to be in schools. There are a few web-based tools, apparently focused at schools: [http://www.curriculummapper.com](http://www.curriculummapper.com), [http://www.techpaths.com/](http://www.techpaths.com/), and [http://www.rubiconatlas.com/](http://www.rubiconatlas.com/).

Some - much? - of what's been done in higher education seems to originate from the generic skills push/literature/practice. One example is a paper by Sumsion and Goodfellow (2004). The stuff in the [AUQA](http://www.auqa.edu.au/) good practice database appear to be directly related to graduate attributes - [mapping](http://www.auqa.edu.au/gp/search/detail.php?gp_id=1102) and [integrating/mapping](http://www.auqa.edu.au/gp/search/detail.php?gp_id=1608).

The other major source in higher education appears to be the medical and health disciplines (e.g. Harden, 2001; Holycross, 2006). Holycross (2006) report on using Excel for their maps. As mentioned in the previous post the University of Virginia School of Nursing appeared to be [doing some work in this area](http://www.iamse.org/conf/conf12/abstracts/Assessment/ed%20-%20jackson.htm), but I can't find much beyond the above.
