Another early update today - off to the Crocodile Farm as an excursion [with the boys](http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/3891084465/) so today's a write off. However, progress has been good and the end is nigh for chapter 2 - at least in first draft.

### What I've done

The aim for this week was to complete the pedagogy component. The component will have three sections: [The centrality of the pedagogue](/blog2/2009/09/07/pedagogy-the-centrality-of-the-pedagogue-and-what-they-believe/) (done); Learning theories, research and advice for pedagogues (about half done); and Lessons from Pedagogy for e-learning (most of the ideas in place - these are generally quick to get done).

### What I'll do in the next week

Two main aims for next week:

1. Complete the pedagogy section and get Chapter 2 all together.
2. Get started on chapter 5.
