      content: "Congratulations on success in securing Carrick support!  The project sounds\
        \ very exciting and timely. All the best with it.\n\nRe inter-institutional collaboration,\
        \ my advice would be in the form of some questions about the inter-organisational\
        \ through to inter-personal nature of the project ...\n\nHas the group of people\
        \ previously collaborated effectively, and if so what were the factors and also\
        \ the tricky bits? How often and how formally do you need to confer as a whole\
        \ group on project progress? How will the project be affected if someone moves\
        \ elsewhere?\n\nIs there a measurable outcome planned in relation to organisational\
        \ change or improvement in both places? Does each party understand what outcomes\
        \ the others need / expect from the project?\n\nDo both organisations have to\
        \ make major infrastructure or HR commitments to make it work? Who\u2019s managing\
        \ the project staff and making the day-to-day decisions about timelines and budget\
        \ expenditure?\n\nWill communications with others (participants, testers, implementers,\
        \ evaluators, etc) be handled on behalf of both partners equally, or is there\
        \ a clear differentiation of roles, as in lead institution and support institution?\
        \  Who will do what, and who else will be acknowledged, in the plans for dissemination\
        \ and scholarly communication?"

        I have had some experience in this area as a member of AWEDU (Active Worlds Educational
        Universe) in around 1999/2000. http://www.activeworlds.com/edu/index.asp That
        was way before this stuff started to become supercool.
    
        I think interest in AWEDU waned somewhat after they began to charge for involvement.
    
        If you are looking for any assistance from another CQU Faculty please register
        my interest.
    
        Am pretty up-to-date with social networking online having just developed the a
        new course for the BDI: DGTL12002, "Innovations in Interactivity &amp; Social
        Networks". That work has tied in with a PhD student''s supervision and I anticipate
        some papers emerging soon.'

I received notice today from [Penny de Byl](http://www.sci.usq.edu.au/staff/bailliep/) that an application for a [Carrick Institute](http://www.carrickinstitute.edu.au/carrick/go) competitive grant had been successful.

Under the title "The seamless integration of Web3D technologies with university curricula to engage the changing student cohort" the project involves teams from both [USQ](http://www.usq.edu.au/) and [CQU](http://www.cqu.edu.au) draw on technical expertise of a USQ [research group](http://www.alivex3d.org/tiki-index.php) to integrate the use of 3D virtual worlds into learning.

So now that the surprise and joy at being successful has passed the question turns to actually doing the work and hopefully not making too many mistakes.

Next week, as chance would have it, I'll be attending a Carrick function so I hope to start the process of picking the brains of previous recipients about the mistakes to avoid and the good practices to follow.

Any suggestions?

I think it will be especially interesting that this proposal will be inter-organisational. Everything I "know" from the information systems literature is that inter-organisational projects are that much harder to do successfully.
