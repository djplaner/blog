According to their website [CAUDIT](http://www.caudit.edu.au/) is described as

> The Council of Australian University Directors of IT (CAUDIT), includes the CIOs or IT Directors of every university in Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Fiji, as well as the CIOâ€™s of prestigious research institutions, CSIRO and AIMS.

Last week I came across the CAUDIT CIO's [top 10 issues list for 2006](http://www.caudit.edu.au/member_notices/index.html#tentopissues). The list is

1. Business Continuity / Disaster Recovery
2. Identity Management : Authentication, Authorisation, Access
3. Funding / Resourcing
4. Work Force Planning: Recruitment, Training, Succession, Retention, Change Management
5. Security
6. Governance
7. Service Management : Support and Delivery: Availability, Capacity, Change Management
8. Information Management : Storage, Archiving, Records Management
9. Legacy Systems : Administration : Student Management / ERP
10. Strategic Planning

What I found interesting was that e-learning, teaching and learning, research and other core tasks for universities did not rank a mention.

In fact, the entire top 10 issues list is focused on issues that have an internal focus. A focus on how IT does some task. No mention of how IT will focus on something important to the organisation.

Sure security, continuity, governance etc are all important and enable the institution and its aims. If they weren't there, the institution would be in trouble.

What about strategic planning? Isn't that outward looking. Maybe. But it's usually more inward looking than outward.

At least the [EDCAUSE list](http://www.educause.edu/apps/er/erm06/erm0633.asp) included something along those lines.

1. Security and Identity Management
2. Funding IT
3. Administrative/ERP/Information Systems
4. Disaster Recovery/Business Continuity
5. **Faculty Development, Support, and Training**
6. Infrastructure
7. Strategic Planning
8. Governance, Organization, and Leadership
9. **E-Learning/Distributed Teaching and Learning**
10. Web Systems and Services
