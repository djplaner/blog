| **You Are An INTP** |
| :-: |
| The Thinker      You are analytical and logical - and on a quest to learn everything you can.   Smart and complex, you always love a new intellectual challenge.   Your biggest pet peeve is people who slow you down with trivial chit chat.   A quiet maverick, you tend to ignore rules and authority whenever you feel like it.      You would make an excellent mathematician, programmer, or professor. |
