Over the next couple of years [CQU](http://www.cqu.edu.au/) is going to be looking into how it should enable students to make use of [Personal Learning Environments](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_Learning_Environment).

As part of that investigation CQU's [Curriculum Design and Development Unit](http://cddu.cqu.edu.au/) is organising a [symposium titled "Personal Learning Environments: How can we harness ICTs to effectively support lifelong learning?"](http://cddu.cqu.edu.au/index.php/PLE_2007_Symposium). The symposium will be held as part of the [2008 Lifelong Learning Conference](http://lifelonglearning.cqu.edu.au/2008/index.htm).

We are interested hearing from anyone who has an interest in PLEs, done or thought anything interesting about how institutions can better support lifelong learning through the use of ICTs.

See the [symposium page](http://cddu.cqu.edu.au/index.php/PLE_2007_Symposium) for more details.
