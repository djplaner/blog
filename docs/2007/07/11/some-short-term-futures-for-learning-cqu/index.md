      content: 'The question would have to be asked are the students truly customers/clients
        of a system, or have they been a neglected human resource of a university system
        (through a collegial mechanism ) in who power have previously been unattainable/untapped.
    
    
        The drive of soft and hard solutions to learning environments/tools is an onslaught
        it is just as  difficult a task as taking up an ES/ERP, students are a factor
        to understand as being diverse as staff inside a university. Not everyone has
        the ability to, or though most would take a serious tilt regardless at the ability
        to build. Different mindsets and a students current understanding of how they
        prefer to use their sets of learning abilities which have been developing for
        sometime now before coming to university.
    
    
        If an innovation produces a steep learning curve for grappling it''s operation
        then the potential is there that students or staff will take a minimalist approach
        which happens often in universities. Empowering users at any thread of a learning
        environment inside a system is a solid idea.
    
    
        I hope the diversity of innovation under development can match the multi-threads
        students use to engage/capture while undertaking a learning experience. While
        staff (education, resource, service, technical, learning, etc) find solutions
        from the diversity of innovative solutions to be learning enablers, supporters,
        mentors, etc.
    
    
        Have to stop mid-thought here, out of time.
    
        Cheers

      content: 'G''day Sarr,
    
    
        Thank you for the comments.
    
    
        Your question about students is an important one, and I''m not sure there is any
        single, simple answer around the view of how/where students sit and should be
        seen.
    
    
        To many times considerations of where/how to see students is reduced to a simple
        either/or argument between the market forces side, which sees student as client,
        and the old academic perspective.  The collegial mechanism you''ve mentioned.
    
    
        I''m hoping we can develop/adopt/work out a middle ground, or perhaps a brand
        new route.
    
    
        We really do need to figure out how to effectively understand the student perspective.
        This is one of our big questions.
    
    
        David.'

On Monday I gave a presentation titled "Some short-term futures of learning @ CQU". The aim was to provide [CQU](http://www.cqu.edu.au/) staff with an understanding of the services and work being done by [CD&DU](http://webclass.cqu.edu.au/).

The slides and video of the presentation are [available here](http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/Publications/Presentations/shortTermFutures/)

It uses the metaphor of developing a course as being similar to building a house or other type of building. With this metaphor, the academic becomes the owner-builder and CD&DU becomes the associated building trades. It then introduces two example of the recent CD&DU work.
