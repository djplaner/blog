        In my previous post, I discussed a project where I was asked to prepare a training
        workshop introducing educators to Second Life and provide them with skills to
        be able to navigate this virtual world.  Skills they could then use to explore
        and learn mo...'

[The group](http://cddu.cqu.edu.au/) I work with is charged with helping [CQUniversity](http://www.cquni.edu.au/) staff make use of various innovations around educational technology. One of the difficulties if giving staff a taste of the breadth of possibilities for what a new technology might be able to do.

One tool for doing that is a taxonomy, [conceptual framework](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conceptual_framework) or a theory for analysis and description ([Gregor 2006](http://www.ise.canberra.edu.au/un6797/Shirley/No6-MISQ%20RA%203828%20theory%20sub%205%20260705%20final-f.pdf)). These essentially attempt to generate some sort of classification or mapping of a topic area into a number of distinct (and hopefully useful) components/categories.

Some examples related to our need around educational technology include (though not necessarily strictly speaking a taxonomy/framework)

- a [Flickr image](http://flickr.com/photos/wfryer/435697374/) for thinking instructionally about Web 2.0 tools
- a [guide to social e-learning](http://socialelearning.flexiblelearning.net.au/social_elearning/index.htm)

### What makes a good descriptive theory

[Gregor 2006](http://www.ise.canberra.edu.au/un6797/Shirley/No6-MISQ%20RA%203828%20theory%20sub%205%20260705%20final-f.pdf) offers the following suggestions about a good/useful descriptive theory

- little is known about some phenomena,
- descriptions should correspond as far as possible to “what is”,
- the classification system is useful in aiding analysis in some way,
- the category labels and groupings are meaningful and natural,
- the hierarchies of classification are appropriate,
- the logic for placement of phenomena into categories should be clear,
- the logic for the characteristics that define each category should be clear,
- the classification system should be complete and exhaustive.

### A suggestion - the 7 principles

CQUniversity has adopted the 7 Principles of Good Practice in Education by Chickering and Gamson ([1987](http://honolulu.hawaii.edu/intranet/committees/FacDevCom/guidebk/teachtip/7princip.htm)) as important to its learning and teaching. One obvious suggestion would be to use those as part of a taxonomy. Especially if the 7 Principles is widely used elsewhere at CQUniversity. It should theoretically become more useful and more clear to our staff if we use this in many places.

The 7 principles, by themselves, may not be sufficient. Perhaps we need to think of supplementing it with other dimensions. Some options here might include Tony Bates' [ACTION model](http://www.eurodl.org/materials/review/2005/Bates_review.htm). Though I wonder if that might be starting to get too overwhelming.

Obviously time to be looking at some literature.
