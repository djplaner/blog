The following is step 2 in getting organised for a trial of [VoiceThread](http://voicethread.com/) as part of the [PLEs@CQUni project](http://cddu.cqu.edu.au/index.php/PLEs%40CQUni). The background was given in a [previous post](http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/?p=197).

This post tries to summarise what's been found about create a presentation in Voice Thread. It's more a work in progress and a way of saving what I'm finding, rather than any particular use for anyone else.

It appears that a presentation (i.e. like Powerpoint) might be one approach to support the development of an online research poster. Much of this information is taken from the [VoiceThread Tutorials](http://voicethread.com/#c28) example on [VoiceThread Presentations](http://voicethread.com/#c28.b23349.i137777).

The example is a nice example, includes the talking head and some doodling.

It's that hard a process, apparently includes the following steps

- Create the presentation file.  
    VoiceThread suggest that the presentation file should be PDF and 1024x768 or larger with a 4:3 aspect ratio. Powerpoint, at least on the Mac, has it as an export option.
- Upload it to Slideshare.  
    This seems a fairly simple process, need to set the options. The [1 minute VoiceThread](http://voicethread.com/#c28.b8381.i61448) tutorial gives a good introduction.
- Set some options - collaboration  
    Has the ability to invite people, make it public, moderate comments and include the voice thread in public list. Will need to include this in a screen cast.
- Record the narration.  
    Using voice thread's 5 methods of recording.

Comments on VoiceThreads appear to require that you have a VoiceThread account. This will be a bit of a limitation when it comes to having visitors to the research poster session comment on the posters.

Interesting that [Slideshare](http://slideshare.net) does offer a "guest comment" facility that requires you are able to read a captcha, rather than login.
