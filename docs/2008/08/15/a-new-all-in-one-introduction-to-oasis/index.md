A new introduction to OASIS was delivered in a 90 minute session today to a collection of [CQUni](http://www.cqu.edu.au/) staff from a number of campuses. The 100+ slides and accompanying video provide an introduction to all aspects of OASIS which are covered in more detail in separate slidecasts available from the main [OASIS page](http://cddu.cqu.edu.au/index.php/OASIS).
