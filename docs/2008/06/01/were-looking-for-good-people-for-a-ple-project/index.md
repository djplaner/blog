It is official. The advertising has [gone out/up](http://www.seek.com.au/users/apply/index.ascx?Sequence=48&PageNumber=1&jobid=12886345) for two positions for the CQU [PLE project](http://cddu.cqu.edu.au/index.php/Personal_Learning_Environments_%40_CQU). The initial [proposal for the project](http://cddu.cqu.edu.au/index.php/PLE_Proposal) provides some ideas of the origins of the project which seeks to build on some of the baby steps we've already taken down this route.

We're seeking two complimentary people. One with the learning design/educational background and one with a technical background. Together they will work closely to help support CQU students and staff as they take some steps towards the use of personal learning environments.

The two positions are research positions. As well as supporting staff and students it is hoped that the people appointed can make contributions to knowledge to help CQU and others learn more about PLEs and their effective use.
