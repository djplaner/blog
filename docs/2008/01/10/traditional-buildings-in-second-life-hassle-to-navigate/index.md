      content: "G'day Ken,\n\nThanks for the comment.\n\nI'm a great fan of the concept\
        \ of a \"wicked problem\" (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem) as applied\
        \ to learning and teaching, especially when technology is involved.  And as can\
        \ be seen in other posts in my blog I have an on-going interest in how complexity\
        \ theory might help inform what we do.\n\nThat's a round about way of saying that\
        \ I don't think there is a universally unique solution the suits every learning\
        \ situation or even every course at CQU, or even course within a particular program.\
        \ And I certainly do not have the unique answer.\n\nI'm just trying some things,\
        \ sharing my thoughts and experiences.\n\nMy experience (as a participant) with\
        \ products like ElluminateLive have not been all that great so that probably biases\
        \ me against them.  I'm not a fan of most synchronous teaching methods as I prefer\
        \ time to reflect and consider.  Another bias on my part.\n\nIn addition, my teaching\
        \ experience has been predominantly in courses with large cohorts of distance\
        \ education students for whom synchronous communication approaches are not all\
        \ that appropriate.  Again something that probably colours my bias. As does the\
        \ fact that synchronous sessions at CQU are either done face-to-face or using\
        \ existing institutional infrastructure.\n\nSo within the CQU context, I've yet\
        \ to see a huge need for such products.  Which is very different from saying that\
        \ there isn't a need.  I've just not seen it.\n\nI'm aware of Croquet and have\
        \ played around with it. It's underlying technology appears to be much more powerful\
        \ but it is also somewhat less friendly than Second Life, at least initially.\n\
        \nCertainly it's much easier to get on, experience Second Life and visit a lot\
        \ of different, cool applications than it is with Croquet.\n\nSecond Life's major\
        \ advantage is numbers. I don't have figures, but it is my belief, that Second\
        \ Life has many more members and companies building and using it.  There are tools\
        \ and approaches that can re-create the Elluminate like functionality within Second\
        \ Life.\n\nSecond Life also has more people sharing their knowledge, experience\
        \ and outcomes.  Especially other university academics. For educators gettings\
        \ started in a new environment this cannot be under-estimated. Second Life lets\
        \ academics get \"in world\" easily, see lots of other folk doing interesting\
        \ stuff, learn from them and start creating things themselves.\n\nThis is not\
        \ something that's possible with other similar 3D technologies.\n\nWhile a major\
        \ use of Second Life is sychronous communication. It can also be used for an awful\
        \ lot more than that. It and other 3D platforms allow a great range of applications\
        \ than Elluminate does.\n\nSome examples, and there are many more,\n<ul>\n  <li>\
        \ Machinima like that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases\"\
        \ rel=\"nofollow\">produced at CQU for ACCT19064</a> to supplement case studies\n\
        \  </li>\n  <li> Stand alone simulations like <a href=\"http://www.massively.com/2008/02/18/a-tour-around-the-testis-education-in-second-life/\"\
        \ rel=\"nofollow\">a tour of the testis</a>.\n  </li>\n  <li> Integration with\
        \ traditional learning systems like <a href=\"http://www.sloodle.com/\" rel=\"\
        nofollow\">Sloodle</a> a method for integrating Second Life with the Moodle course\
        \ management system </li>\n</ul>\n\nDavid."

      content: 'To share info, there are some interesting applications developed which
        compare with SL.
    
    
        Some educators have suggested the "2D" aspect of online virtual teaching (eLearning)
        can be most effective. Proponents of this approach (such as myself), recommend
        products such as Adobe Acrobat Connect and ElluminateLive. Here is one of many
        online presentations about this Elluminate product, that is given using that product
        - http://del.icio.us/tags/LiveConferences
    
    
    
        An interesting contemporary trend is the "3D" Second Life (SL) approach. Advocates
        of this technology suggest the life-like interaction improves the learning experience.
        A very interesting and powerful alternative to Second Life is CROQUET - a commercial
        product called "QUAK" has been developed which is similar to SL. Here is a neat
        presentation that discussed QUAK and the extensions that allow more intereaction
        (including integration to ElluminateLive and other 2D as well as 3D spaces):

        I would appreciate feedback on above.

      content: 'I''m only about 3 years late in my reply. Nonetheless I would agree with
        David''s ideology to continue exploring with next-generation e-learning tools.
        Being a multidisciplinary professor  - (I teach diverse subjects such Human Resource
        Management, Quantitative Analysis Models, Business Strategy, Advanced Statistics,
        Marketing Consumer Behavior, Multicultural Organizational Leadership) - I sincerely
        advocate the concept of allowing students to animate themselves as a mode of communicating
        (if it helps their learning). Also, 3D type of products should appease the active
        and visual learning styles (from my research typically 80% of students prefer
        visual over textual learning input dimensions). Good ideas and keep the ideas
        going!

Starting to move around a bit more in Second Life and it hasn't taken long to hate walls. Traditional buildings with a roof, walls, corridors and small doorways seem to be designed to make navigation a hassle.

The following is an example of a navigation experience this morning where as I walk around inside a building, then turnaround I am (or at least the perspective I have from behind my avatar is) suddenly flung out of the building. Somewhat disconcerting.

[![Building](http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/building.thumbnail.jpg)](http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/building.jpg "Building")

I would imagine a seasoned navigator within 3D worlds would take this as a given and work around it. But, at least to me, it raises the question of just how far you should go with re-creating the real-world in Second Life.

I'm sure this is not a new question but as we're starting our journey into Second Life it is a question that needs to be asked. Already some folk are wanting to re-create physical campus buildings in Second Life. Is that the right thing to do?

This certainly seems to be a common trend amongst many other universities. [CQU](http://www.cqu.edu.au/) has some major differences with those other universities which makes this practice somewhat less sensible. These include

- In 2007 we had over 15 different campuses at which students might be located.
- The largest grouping of students in 2007 were distance education students (who rarely, if ever, come onto a campus) with 33% of the student population.
- The largest campus in percentage terms was the Sydney campus with 19.4%. It is one of CQU's international campuses and is based in a couple of CBD buildings in Sydney.
- Rockhampton, the first CQU campus and the one at which CQU senior executive is housed, had 12% of the 2007 student population (Sydney 19.4%, Melbourne 13.4% then Rockhampton).
- The institution has only existed for about 40 years and has only been a full university since the early 1990s (see [CQU history](http://www.cqu.edu.au/about/history.htm)).
- At least from my perspective, none of the buildings are all that memorable or noteworthy.

If we were to re-create some real CQU buildings in Second Life. Which building would we choose? From which campus?

Walls are needed in real life to keep the weather out, the roof up and provide some privacy. the first two of those reasons probably don't exist in Second Life. Does the third? Do we need to retain walls for privacy? Are there alternate Second Life means to provide privacy?

Retaining a semblance of reality in Second Life can, theoretically, help folk feel familiar and more comfortable. But I wonder if the hassles of navigating within real life buildings in Second Life overwhelms that benefit.

I wonder if you could instead, create spaces that small indicators of real life but don't go the whole hog. For example, have a meeting space within a small forest clearing that includes a few logs to sit on, a whiteboard and a few other artifacts from a class room. The artifacts provide the familiarity but the open space makes it easy to get around.
