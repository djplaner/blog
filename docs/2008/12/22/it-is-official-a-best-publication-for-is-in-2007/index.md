I don't like to brag, but you don't get this sort of thing all that often.

Last week I was in Paris for the [ICIS'2008 conference](http://www.icis2008.org/). The main reason for going to the conference was to receive an award.

It turns out that the [The Anatomy of a Design Theory](http://aisel.aisnet.org/jais/vol8/iss5/1/) by [Professor Shirley Gregor](http://www.cbe.anu.edu.au/staff/info.asp?Surname=Gregor&Firstname=Shirley) and myself has been voted as one of the 5 best publications within the Information Systems discipline by a group of senior scholars.

That goes with being the paper of 2007 for the [Journal of the Association for Information Systems](http://aisel.aisnet.org/jais/).

Thanks Shirley.

I was going to include a photo the little plaque we each received but that was perhaps taking things a bit too far.
