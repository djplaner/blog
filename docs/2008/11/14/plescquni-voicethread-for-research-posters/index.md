Last night the [PLEs@CQUni project](http://cddu.cqu.edu.au/index.php/PLEs%40CQUni) helped support a public session titled "Psychology and Public Health Infotainment". The purpose was to show the relevant local community practitioners research posters prepared by students in [CQUni](http://www.cqu.edu.au) course - PSYCH13021, Special Topic in Psychology.

Our involvement was to help in the use of [VoiceThread](http://voicethread.com) as a means to present the students' posters and enable visitors to make comments on the research posters.

The [complete list](http://cddu.cqu.edu.au/index.php/Voice_Thread_for_Research_Posters) of all the posters is available.

Overall the experience of the whole project has been positive and proven how, with a bit of help, that many of the growing number of available services on the web can help improve learning and teaching at universities.

This small scale and very simple project was simply investigating how it would work, gathering some more knowledge. Based on the experience, it would be pretty easy to leverage this and similar tools to make a dramatic impact.
