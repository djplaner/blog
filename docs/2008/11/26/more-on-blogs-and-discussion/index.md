In some previous posts ([the original post](/blog2/2008/11/26/an-experiment-in-blog-based-discussions/) and [the followup post](/blog2/2008/11/26/some-resources-for-around-blogs-and-discussion-forums/)) I've been playing around using blogs for multiple discussion forums. As yet, no-one else has joined in :(. Which is not surprising, to some extent, given at least one of the bits of my experiment in the [followup post](/blog2/2008/11/26/some-resources-for-around-blogs-and-discussion-forums/) did not work.

This post attempts to explain what didn't work and in the process introduce some basics of blogs and discussions as per the Wordpress.com

### Introducing pingbacks

In the [followup post](/blog2/2008/11/26/some-resources-for-around-blogs-and-discussion-forums/) I included a link back to the [the original post](/blog2/2008/11/26/an-experiment-in-blog-based-discussions/). What was supposed to happen can be seen on this [unrelated post](/blog2/2008/11/15/expert-designer-another-assumption-ples-question/). There are a number of responses to the post, including a number that were made using the method I attempted.

Wordpress call this method a [pingback](http://codex.wordpress.org/Introduction_to_Blogging#Pingbacks). The concept of a pingback expands upon, and at least for some, improves on the idea of a [trackback](http://codex.wordpress.org/Introduction_to_Blogging#Trackbacks).

It looks like pingbacks don't work all the time.
