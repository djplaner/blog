I'm trying to run an [experiment in blog-based discussions](/blog/2008/11/26/an-experiment-in-blog-based-discussions/). Trying to understand, from experience, the realities of using individual blogs for a multi-person discussion. It's not going well.

The first problem was that Wordpress' pingbacks not always working - as briefly mentioned in [this post](/blog/2008/11/26/more-on-blogs-and-discussion/). The next problem is that links from an external blog (in particular one from Blogger), aren't currently working in a way that is particularly useful for tracking a conversation.

Tony has attempted to join in the conversation from his [blogger](http://www.blogger.com) hosted [blog](http://www.vrbones.com/) via this <a href="[post](http://www.vrbones.com/2008/11/conversations-by-trackback.html). He's included a link to my original post in his post. Apparently blogger doesn't support trackbacks.

His link has not showed up on the post. However, on the admin interface for my blog there is a section that tracks all links point to my blog posts. Tony's link has shown up there. Which isn't all that useful for folk trying to following the conversation.

The question will be whether or not there is a configuration setting or a plugin I can enable on my blog to get around this problem. That's a next task.
