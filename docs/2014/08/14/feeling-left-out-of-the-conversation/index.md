        I get it, if no one is responding to my posts it illustrates what happens in the
        online world where you can be a lone blogger until you begin actively networking
        and making contacts, then overtime people who like your ideas or at least identify
        them may begin connecting with you.
    
    
        Regards,

      content: 'Important observation Annelise. A lot of folk use their online writing
        to "think aloud" about stuff, for example, other than David''s excellent think
        aloud writing, I like Mark Johnson''s improvisation blog: http://dailyimprovisation.blogspot.com.au/   It
        takes time and a bit of patience to get noticed if that is what you are after.
        It''s perhaps worth thinking about who your "readership" is right now. In a course
        one or perhaps two people may read your work. It''s a lot like "fridge door" publishing,
        what happens when a child brings their homework back from school with a green
        elephant stamp on it. It gets "published" at home on the fridge door and then,
        after a time discretely removed. If getting noticed is your aim then there is
        no shortage of advice about how to do that. Working on tricky ideas can be its
        own reward, particularly if you are willing to share you thinking publicly. That''s
        the difference between the then (pre read/write web) and now. When you make something
        public you probably give it a little more thought, care, attention than if you
        were writing in a notebook for yourself (not a bad idea also) :)'

      content: 'Hi Chris,
    
        Thank you for taking the time to offer such a considered response. I appreciate
        the link too. :)
    
    
        That is one of my realisations that I need to begin posting my thought processes
        about what I am going through and how I am construing what I am reading or doing.
    
    
        I knew that the blogosphere would not take notice but I didn''t expect members
        of the course not to actively engage with each other. I think I just expected
        it as that is what we have been conditioned to do. After David''s post I realised
        that the configuration of the course is to reflect the real-world of blogging.
        It is a good thing as i wanted theory that was combined with practice and that
        is what this course very much is. In fact, out of all the study I did in my bachelor
        I don''t remember any subject being as real-world as this one.
    
    
        Regards,
    
        Annelise'

[In a comment](http://muzedujourney.wordpress.com/2014/07/28/the-ups-and-downs/comment-page-1/#comment-9) on [this post](http://muzedujourney.wordpress.com/2014/07/28/the-ups-and-downs/) about the ups and downs participants are going through in the NGL course Mari shares the struggles of being offline in this type of a course. The feeling where being offline feels a bit like you've left the conversation and have fallen behind the evolution of where the others are up to.

I'm wondering whether is something inherent in a NGL course, or whether it's a combination of a bunch of other stuff.

### Learn to love the ignorance

I wonder how much of this is similar to [Elisha's worry](http://futurelearningmusings.wordpress.com/2014/07/30/me-as-a-student/) about keeping "up to date with the latest educational trends and research". In an NGL world can you know everything or keep up with all the conversations? Should you even try? Should you instead do what works for you, maintain and build your connections to others, and use those connections in ways useful and appropriate to you.

In an NGL course, do you have to learn to stop worrying and love the knowledge you can't know everything?

And doing this is hard.

### Uncertainty

The NGL course itself has been emerging fairly quickly. This has likely created an enhanced level of uncertainty amongst participants beyond the need to make the above transformation. Something that hasn't been helped perhaps by the lack of appropriate modeling of this practice from others.

### Groups versus networks

I wonder if the distinction between network and group is also part of this. Many online courses take the group approach. People working toward common outcomes or projects. Which in turns requires a more synchronous approach to participation as others are directly depending on your contribution.

[![Fixed: In sheep clothing by manitou2121, on Flickr](images/367078204_0412ed840e_m.jpg "Fixed: In sheep clothing by manitou2121, on Flickr")](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pierre_tourigny/367078204/)

The NGL course is (in my head) trying to take a more network approach. There isn't a common outcome or project. Everyone is working on their own projects as student, learner and teacher. They are working on roughly the same schedule but it's intended to be a fairly flexible schedule. You do what you need, when you need it as much as possible. With there really only being two fixed deadlines, and even they are fairly flexible.

If you need to drop out for a while and work on something, then you should be able to and then reconnect as needed when you return. Perhaps not necessarily catch up on all the conversations. Plus if ideas have moved on, that's a positive in terms of being able to learn from that.

Do others feel this about the course? Or is it just a group-based online course in a network course's clothing?
