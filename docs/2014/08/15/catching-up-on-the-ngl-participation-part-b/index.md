      content: Thank you for picking up on my referencing issue. This is what is great
        about online networks, we can correct each other in real-time, in contrast to
        traditional assessments where those issues are often overlooked, and that is not
        a good thing. I am wondering whether this illustrates how networked environments
        will hold us accountable because peers act as a checking system for what is valid
        and what is not. This is also one of the reasons why I think Wikipedia is so successful.

      content: Not sure I'd use the word "accountable" given its other negative connotations,
        but I do think this is one of the benefits of making our learning more open.  It's
        some of what Dron and Anderson talk about as the "wisdom of the crowd" and in
        the open source community has been labelled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law"
        rel="nofollow">"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow"</a>

So Part B of the [NGL catch up](/blog/2014/08/12/catching-up-on-the-ngl-participation/). Main focus here will be on the 11 participants blogs I haven't yet caught up on and a to do list to follow up on.

## The challenge of now knowing

[Tracey](http://learningforinsight.wordpress.com/me-as-student/) reflects on the challenges posed in crossing disciplines linked with the almost traditional challenge that the more open approach to NGL poses.

But she's also tackling the challenge in an organised way. For example, setting up her [own glossary](http://learningforinsight.wordpress.com/resources/glossary/) and discovering new tools. [Trello](https://trello.com/) is a new one to me and looks exactly like the type of tool I've been thinking about recently. This looks like a real find.

Tracey also has an [interesting post](http://learningforinsight.wordpress.com/2014/08/06/the-evolution-of-a-system-ad-hoc-to-organised/) on getting organised, but I wonder whether she's missed a very NGL type solution

### Brick walls

[![Brick Wall by larstho, on Flickr](images/4632635380_115cf65a5f_m.jpg "Brick Wall by larstho, on Flickr")](https://www.flickr.com/photos/solarflare/4632635380/)

It appears [Eleisha may have broken](http://futurelearningmusings.wordpress.com/2014/08/13/like-learning-to-ride-a-bike/comment-page-1/) through the brick wall concept that is NGL etc. It's good to see some increasing evidence of this.

I'm wondering whether there is anyway to make it easier to achieve this? Does the fact that I've broken through that brick wall and as Bigum and Rowan (2013) suggestion the bottom rungs of the ladder have fallen away for me, mean that I can't do that. Perhaps that's a cop out. A bit more work required here.

And some more [suggestion of broken brick walls](http://futurelearningmusings.wordpress.com/2014/08/13/ah-ha-as-a-student/) and light bulb moments.

### Cheese making

Oh that is interesting. Goksu is [planning to learn](http://ggdines.wordpress.com/2014/08/04/48/) how to make cheese in warm climates (that climate might make a difference reveals my ignorance). The more I see of the variety of topics people are exploring, the more I like the choice of assignment. Shall be interesting to see how it all evolves.

### NGL applied to central L&T support

Interesting there appears to be a number of participants ([one](http://ggdines.wordpress.com/2014/08/04/week-1-me-as-teacher/), [two](http://debliriges.wordpress.com/2014/08/03/me-as-teacher/), [three](http://pushingtheboundarieswithnetworkedlearning.wordpress.com/2014/08/03/me-as-a-teacher/)) who are engaged in "central L&T support". i.e. employed by an organisation to help teaching staff develop their teaching. They'll be seeking to apply NGL to their practice. In fact, it's the major aim of assignment 2.

### A bit of self-organising and critique

Also nice to see [some self-organising](http://ggdines.wordpress.com/2014/08/04/lets-curate-together-a-suggestion/) occurring.

Even better to see some [critique coming out](http://ggdines.wordpress.com/2014/08/11/where-has-ngl-come-from/) of the course.

### The constrains of assessment and concepts

[Annelise touches](http://lifechanginglearning.blogspot.com.au/2014/08/me-as-student.html) on the constraints of assessment and

> how the consistent focus on assessment would prevent any discussion of other ideas that may or may not be directly related to the exam or assignment.

It will be interesting to see how well the assessment for NGL avoids this problem. There's already a bit of tension around the assessment, or perhaps more correctly it's lack of clarity. Something I need to look into.

Perhaps the issue arises from another point from Annelise

> Learning, regardless of the environment, should foster the ability of individuals to actively participate in creating something that they, themselves, find as valuable.

Perhaps by engaging in NGL participants are finding their way in terms of being able to actively participate in learning, but perhaps the assessment isn't helping them create something they find valuable.

Ahh, the Pomodoro technique. One of those buzz words I've seen circulating through social networks but have never taken the time to explore. Thanks for the pointer [Annelise](http://lifechanginglearning.blogspot.com.au/2014/08/learning-like-master-most-powerful-tool.html). And the quote from Siemens - "The 21st century is a terrible time to be a control freak" - and [its contradiction](http://lifechanginglearning.blogspot.com.au/2014/08/a-sea-of-information-run.html) in the formal education system. Though [this](http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/294678-the-21st-century-is-really-a-terrible-time-to-be) seems to attribute it to Jared Cohen.

Annelise is also writing about what to do when [you're different from your peers](http://lifechanginglearning.blogspot.com.au/2014/08/what-to-do-when-you-are-different-to.html). This speaks to me about the difference between group and network (a particular schema I've been mentioning a lot recently). The NGL approach is not to require similarity, but to actually value the difference. It's the difference that will provide some real benefit. The more we're all the same, the more similar our networks and the less our learning from each other can be. [Goksu worries](http://ggdines.wordpress.com/2014/08/11/where-has-ngl-come-from/) about homophily. Something I hope a network approach can avoid more successfully than a group approach.

Will continue this anon.
