Tracey's found her blogging mojo with a raft of posts (new since I last looked) including [this one](http://learningforinsight.wordpress.com/2014/08/25/conscientiousness-creativity-and-an-online-educational-future/) linking to work that identifies conscientiousness as the main secret to success in much of life. The focus on personality is in common the connections to Myers-Briggs and related ideas that [Brendon](http://willocksb.wordpress.com/2014/08/25/gathering-some-data/) and [Anne](http://astrethewey.wordpress.com/2014/08/28/more-than-you-might-think/) have touched on.

Tried one of the tests Brendon pointed to and it confirmed earlier results - [INTP](http://www.16personalities.com/intp-personality). So at least it's somewhat reliable in a broad, "I haven't changed much" sort of a way. Even if there are some [significant questions](http://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2013/mar/19/myers-briggs-test-unscientific) about it. I wonder whether this labeling of me makes sense to the other NGL participants?

[Tracey's post](http://learningforinsight.wordpress.com/2014/08/25/conscientiousness-creativity-and-an-online-educational-future/) links to some more work that the current formal education system is set up to reward "dependability, perseverance, consistency, following orders, punctuality, and deferring gratification" and penalise "creativity, aggressiveness, and independence" suggesting that schools "promote individuals with the personality traits most associated with 'good workers.'".

i.e. the factory model of formal education produces what it is required of it be the type of society that set it up.

As the folk that participate in a course like NGL (both teacher and student), I wonder whether we're coloured by our time in school? Is this something that might explain part of the struggles getting underway in NGL?

Tracey ends with the $64K question

> How do we encourage educators to adopt methodologies that support such learning?

As alluded to in [my last post](/blog2/2014/08/28/on-trying-to-be-optimistic-in-a-stupid-world/), I'm pessimistic about whether this is possible as achieving that requires systemic change. Or perhaps more explicitly a change in the system and its foundational assumptions. Something which would appear very difficult to happen under current management approaches.

Can you really expect educators change their practices, when the organisation remains the same?

Can you expect educators to be digitally fluent when their organisation isn't digitally fluent? Another member of staff commented today that our institution appears caught in this really strange nether world between an old paper-based organisation and a "network age" organisation. As evidenced by the struggles to get a form signed.

Can a network model of learning and teaching exist in such an environment?
