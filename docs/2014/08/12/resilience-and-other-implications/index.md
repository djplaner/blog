      content: 'Hi David,
    
    
        I have experienced the "enterprise" centralised mindset across a number of educational
        providers and I agree, it was very "clunky," particularly when compared with what
        my students had access to at home. Although Blackboard, and other similar platforms,
        are good, when you compare them to other interfaces, which is almost any modern
        interface on the net, it is slow, cumbersome and really annoying. You mentioned
        how you cannot reply to student posts via your university interface. What I find
        annoying is how for about five days now I have not received any emails notifying
        me about activity on LMS, despite having ticked the boxes asking to be sent notifications.
        Is this normal?
    
    
        As a teacher I did end up using platforms like Edmodo to teach as it was so user-friendly
        and also looked like facebook, which is a plus. I also loved using youtube to
        teach my content by creating videos and allowing students to watch them in their
        own time, like a blended learning model. Some students loved this approach but
        others wanted the traditional paper and pen approach. Nevertheless, I persisted
        by providing paper copies of everything I did, and it did mean a doubling up,
        but at least it prevented complaints.
    
    
        Regards,
    
        Annelise'

What passes for institutional e-learning within Universities appears to be largely stuck in the "enterprise", centralised mindset of the first decade of this century. As the technological environment is changing it is increasingly appearing more and more clunky. This creates challenges for those stuck with these systems and provides impetus to move beyond the confines of institutional systems. An impetus given more kick along for me by the last couple of days observing the difference between the centralised, institutional systems and the ad hoc collection of external systems I rely upon to teach.

As the image suggests, the institutional systems have been having some issues with availability. Issues that have been increasingly frustrating as I've been away for a few days and need to catch up on work related to some online courses. It's not much fun responding to discussion forum posts and requests for extensions when the institutional systems are taking up to minutes to respond and occasionally falling over. Actually it's not all the centralised approach causing the problems. The distribution of institutional technologies is adding to the frustration.

I only know about the discussion forum posts because the LMS is configured to email me whenever someone posts to a forum. These emails are dutifully filtered into a folder for working upon. This means I can see what has been posted in my email client. Even if the LMS is down. The frustration is that whilst I know about the posts, I can't respond.

**Update:** it appears that the email notification of new posts is either down or has been turned off. I haven't gotten any recent emails and there have been forum posts (though not many, I imagine because of the system unavailability). But as it happens the LMS being used (Moodle) does support the option of generating RSS feeds and for this course we have encouraged students to use them. As I look at [Feedly](http://feedly.com/) I can see those new posts and because the LMS is now available, I can respond. The point is that as one form of distributed notification is unavailable, another is available to take its place. Now I could see someone arguing that having both email notification of posts and RSS feeds could be considered duplication and inefficient. But it also increases resilience and diversity.

At least with the other course I'm teaching I'm relying on externally hosted tools that don't rely on the LMS. So when it's down I can still do some work. My practices are a little more resilient due to the distribution made possible by these tools. There's some advantage to not putting all my eggs in one (institutional) basket. Which makes me wonder about an institutional that is pushing "personalised learning" and the promise of partnering "with learners in the pursuit of their study objectives regardless of their background, location or stage in life" that is still largely centralised and pushing ideas such as "one university" and "consistency". Is the "enterprise", institutional, centralised mindset get in the way of the strategic goals?

### But what's the alternative?

What would a more decentralised approach look like? I hesitate to add, what would a "personalised" approach look like? Can a university with an embedded enterprise mindset make such a transition?

It appears that a distributed, personalised approach would require a radical rethinking of the very underpinnings of the strategic management approach to institutions and the attendant IT, HR and other support practices.

And then there's [Postman's point](https://www.cs.ucdavis.edu/~rogaway/classes/188/materials/postman.pdf)

> Technology always has unforeseen consequences and it is not always clear, at the beginning, who or what will win, and who or what will lose...

Most of Postman's other 5 things about technology also generate questions in this case.

The LMS and more broadly the requirement for the institution to provide a fixed set of institutional systems and services seem to have become mythic to universities. Imagining a situation where the instituion doesn't have to provide an e-portfolio system for students is nonsensical in this context.

> Technology tends to become mythic; that is, perceived as part of the natural order of things, and therefore tends to control more of our lives than is good for us.

You can't adopt a new technological approach and expect to have the same organisation, the same policies, the same processes, and the same people.

> Technological change is not additive; it is ecological, which means, it changes everything

This is perhaps one of the challenges facing the participants in the NGL course. When everything changes, it's hard.

With those changes there will be winners and losers. What if the losers are those in positions of power currently?

> There are always winners and losers, and that the winners always try to persuade the losers that they are really winners

### What the alternative isn't

Of course it's possible that the current issues with the institutional systems suggest that the institution hasn't invested sufficient resources to keep up with the requirements of an increasing reliance on the centralised systems. More money spent, more centralisation and more control might prevent this type of downtime from happening again. Which is essentially what out-sourcing the hosting of the systems would involve.

But that alternative is also going to hold the institution back from the increasing distribution of the technological environment. Sacrifice long-term practice for the short-term priority of having a stable system that fits existing mindsets. However, it's also the alternative most likely to occur exactly because it fits the existing mindsets.
