The last couple of weeks have been just a bit hectic and my participation in the network forming about [the NGL course](http://netgl.wordpress.com/) has been less than I'd aimed for. The following is an attempt to document some of the interesting bits I've missed and sign-post them for further action. It's really just an attempt to experiment with what any participant might need to do in such a course if they wanted to catch up. It's a test to see how well some of the technology has been set up and whether it helps capture most of what's happened.

## What's in Feedly?

There's an [OPML file](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14025788/EDU8117.opml) for the course that includes feeds for all the participant blogs (17 or 18), the course blog, the discussion forum feed from the Moodle course (now rarely used), the [Diigo group](https://groups.diigo.com/group/networked-and-global-learning) and [the Mendeley group](http://www.mendeley.com/groups/2465121/networked-and-global-learning/) (I think this is the one tool we I haven't fully explored yet). On Feedly it's showing 172 items from that OPML file that I haven't engaged in. 39 from the Diigo group, 5 from the discussion forum, 19 from Mendeley, 8 from the course blog and 2 from my blog. Leaving 99 as coming from the other participants.

### Discussion forum

Most of the discussion forum posts are announcements/updates from me. Except for one from Anne talking about her ["Because we care" project](http://astrethewey.wordpress.com/2014/07/30/foci-student-project-update/). Must read more about this. We are slowly fazing use of the discussion forum out. So shouldn't be too many more there.

### Mendeley feed

The Mendeley feed appears to include the title and abstract of articles added to the NGL group. I wonder how/if we can share the annotations we make on these papers? Given this functionality, it might be appropriate to use the abstract field for other comments, rather than the abstract. Sadly the RSS feed from Mendeley doesn't appear to use the name of the person who shared a document. For example, [this paper](http://www.mendeley.com/c/7057573054/g/2465121/learning-within-a-connectivist-educational-collective-blog-model-a-case-study-of-uk-higher-by-academic-conferences-international/) was added by [GG Dines](http://www.mendeley.com/profiles/gg-dines/) but it shows up in the RSS feed as either no mention of GG Dines. At least Diigo does better.

### Diigo resources

Good that Diigo's feed clearly includes the name of the person sharing the resources. Though difficult to figure out how to easily add a comment on a resources from the RSS feed. A mix of resources being shared by all, including media stories related to NGL, people to follow, academic papers etc that add to the course readings, resources providing technical help with the tools,. There is the need to encourage folk to add a comment to the resources they share.

As I work through the Diigo feed I'm finding lots of good resources leading to the danger of running down a few rabbit holes. But also good to see that some of the other participants are also using these resources and making connections (e.g. one commented on a blog post shared by another participant and written by a third party).

It does appear, however, that Clare has broken Diigo with her [comments and link here](https://groups.diigo.com/group/networked-and-global-learning/content/european-journal-of-open-distance-and-e-learning-12590444)

## Participant posts

So now to dive into what the other participants have been writing about on their blogs.

### Keeping up

[Elisha worries](http://futurelearningmusings.wordpress.com/2014/07/30/me-as-a-student/)

> How do I ensure I am up to date with the latest educational trends and research.

I'm wondering whether that suggestion fits with a NGL perspective? There's the principle of connectivism "learning is more critical than knowing". Does keeping up mean having the right network connections that keep you up to date? Or is it the right network connections to find out what you need, when you need to know it? Or is it a bit of both? Then there's the Siemens' idea of "know where replacing know what and know how". There is simply too much information for one person to know.

This is a problem I struggle with all the time, I don't "know" enough. At least in the sense most people apply. Siemens (2006) argues

> "Know where" is replacing "know what" and "know how". The rapid, continual knowledge flow cannot be contained and held in the human mind. To survive, we extend ourselves through our networks: computers, humans, databases, and still unfolding new tools. (p. 93)

To a large extent this blog post is an example of extending my mind. There's no way I could capture all of the observations and connections I've made in this post in my head. I'm writing them down here so there's an artefact I can come back to and remind myself. To a large extent that's the primary purpose of this blog.

### Related courses

[Hayat talks](http://hayatfeghalyedu8117.wordpress.com/2014/07/31/me-as-student/) about another course in the program she's doing NGL as part of

> EDU8114 – Online Pedagogy in Practice had a focus on ‘presence’ as learning, including social, teaching and cognitive presence.

I'm assuming that's the [Community of Inquiry model](http://edutechwiki.unige.ch/en/Community_of_inquiry_model). I only recently became aware that there are some other folk here using that model quite heavily. Had assumed it might have been in a course, but didn't know. I wonder what that says about the level of "know where" within the University and between courses?

### Reality of doing it

[Deb talks](http://debliriges.wordpress.com/2014/08/03/me-as-a-student/) about the reality of actually doing it. Where it is either more traditional online learning, or be it NGL. There always appears to be a gap between the fantastic possibilities and the actual doing of it. Reminds me of the my favourite quote about e-learning (image to the right).

Deb also talks about OERs, perhaps another case of a gap between the rhetoric and reality?

And there there's [Deb's interesting connection](http://debliriges.wordpress.com/2014/08/03/me-as-learner/) between [Zentangles](http://www.zentangle.com/) and NGL.

Not to mention Deb's really interesting (and relevant to me) [problem](http://debliriges.wordpress.com/2014/08/03/me-as-teacher/) of exploring how NGL can inform how university academics can be supported to engage more with NGL.

Oh and I like this question from [her minute paper thoughts](http://debliriges.wordpress.com/2014/08/03/minute-paper/)

> How long will it take me to become familiar and comfortable with using the new technology and to feel more comfortable engaging in the public click pedagogy?

How long did it take me? Part of the problem with answering that is when do you start? Playing with computers since I was 15, studying computer science at Uni and teaching Information Technology at University had to have helped. Encouraging budding Systems Administrators to keep a journal also reinforced the benefit of recording what is going on and why things happened.

The WayBack archive suggests that I first [started using a blog](http://web.archive.org/web/20060826223535/http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/) in anger in 2006. Already sharing a bit of stuff. [By 2007](http://web.archive.org/web/20070610091056/http://cq-pan.cqu.edu.au/david-jones/blog/) I was in a new job and sharing more. But even then I was careful with what I shared, but perhaps not as careful as with others.

Will continue this tomorrow
