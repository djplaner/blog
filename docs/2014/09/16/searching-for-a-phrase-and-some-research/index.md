      content: Following, since what you describe is exactly the issue in games and games-based
        learning, education creating special education versions of real games. Sigh...

      content: I'm hearing it now about - we need to create a PLE system for people. Which
        I suppose is the next extension of the e-portfolio thing.  It's frustrating because
        I'm sure I read a good paper or two from back in the day....looks like I might
        have to go searching.

This is a plea for help. I'm certain I remember a particular phrase/concept that arose from some research around educational technology from 10+ years ago (may have been as long as 30 years ago).

It was a phrase/concept that was used to look critically at the tendency for education to create special education versions of real software. i.e. rather than use a standard bit of software - e.g. Word (\*shudder\*) - they would have to use a word processor made specially for education (K12 mostly I believe).

Does this ring any bells for you? Can you point me in a useful direction?

Thanks.
