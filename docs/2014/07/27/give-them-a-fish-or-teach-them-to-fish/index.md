      content: 'Hi David,
    
    
        Every since reading this post I have been intrigued. One of my fundamental beliefs
        is that it is wise to "teach a man to fish" rather than to "give him fish." I
        believe that this is what learning should be about and also leads to the most
        sustained form of learning.
    
    
        What I wanted to comment on is the importance of providing tasks, which you have
        done, that people will apply in the student''s real-world. After many years of
        teaching, both in the high school and university setting, I realised that if what
        is being learned does not require the learner to actively apply the learning to
        their real-world context, they are less likely to retain the knowledge and skills.
        This is the major reason why I chose this course. I wanted something that focused
        on preparing individuals to become active contributors to the world rather than
        passive recipients.
    
    
        There are challenges but without those we would not grow. If there is anything
        I have learnt, getting uncomfortable leads to further growth and change.
    
    
        Thanks for being so forward thinking and propelling your learners into learning
        for themselves.'

      content: 'Hi Tracey,
    
    
        I''m glad to see that you took the time to respond and with such conviction. Awesome!
    
    
        What I found interesting was how you began your post by stating that "There is
        no equality!" I am wondering how you construed teaching someone to fish rather
        than giving them fish as an argument about equality. I agree that many things
        are not equal but I cannot see how that relates to a teacher who chooses to encourage
        their student to learn a skill for themself rather than being provided with information
        and merely only knowing what to do.
    
    
        I think what this course illustrates is the inherent messiness of learning, which
        reflects life in my opinion. In life you learn as you go along, and all learning
        is directed toward helping you achieve your goals. I am wondering whether you
        are putting too much pressure on yourself to know everything perfectly before
        progressing. I once did this as an undergraduate but realised that it was essential
        to use the tools to achieve my desired outcome. If I were you I would focus on
        your goal and use the tools to help you get there. You don''t need to be perfect.
    
    
        Another thing that you have written is "Immersion is only helpful if there are
        mechanisms to prevent drowning." I''m not so sure mechanisms to prevent drowning
        would be a good idea because it would hinder innovation, in other words, other
        ways of doing things. If you were provided with strictly confined instructions,
        such as a step-by-step process, it would encourage passivity rather than productivity
        and most of all, innovation.
    
    
        Thanks for responding.
    
    
        Regards,
    
        Annelise'

[Andrew's main worry](http://globalconnectionusq.wordpress.com/2014/07/25/minute-paper/) is indicative of one of my concerns with both courses I'm currently teaching. Both courses throw the participants in at the deep-end with a few new (to almost all) technologies that the courses draw heavily on. There is varying levels of scaffolding to help, but it stops well short of being involving very detailed and specific instructions.

There are a few reasons for that, including

1. The importance to both courses of students developing the skills to solve their own technical problems.
2. The desire for students to explore the specific technologies that suit them and not be limited to what I recommend.

But learning "how to fish" in this context is not a easy process. Which is both another plus, but also a minus.

So if you are (or have been) a student in EDC3100 or EDU8117, let me know what you think. How did the approach work (or not) for you?

I wonder if there's anyone doing this well that I can gain some insights into how to do it better. Perhaps that something to add to my list of tasks around participating in NGL/EDU8117.
