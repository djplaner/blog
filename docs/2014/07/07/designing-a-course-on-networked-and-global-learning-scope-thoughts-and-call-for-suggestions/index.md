The machinations of University decision making are always (more than) a bit obscure, opaque and uncertain. Especially when the institution has just been through a restructure. Late last week I found out that the [Networked and Global Learning" Masters course](http://www.usq.edu.au/course/specification/2014/EDU8117-S2-2014-WEB-TWMBA.html) I was allocated to would actually run. Since the course was last re-developed sometime ago, I've also pushed for the opportunity to bring it into the modern network age. Hence this this post.

Semester starts in two weeks time. By then I need to design most of the course and have a few weeks implemented. Given the topic (networked and global learning), the limited amount of time, and my limitations it's only sensible to do this in the open and hopefully benefit from the network.

If you have any thoughts, ideas, or resources that might be helpful please feel free to suggest. Either in the comments below or in [this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1icZ4qS0__Ma2nL38JicH9EWEy7M9SOQSAZc40W0ytlg/edit?usp=sharing) that has some initial thoughts and resources.

### The initial model

The course synopsis (which I have to align with) includes stuff like

- critically examine the practice of networked and global learning (N&GL) using a variety of theoretical lenses
- situate themselves within N&GL communities
- and investigate, reflect upon and evaluate their experiences of N&GL.
- include an exploration of current tools for and trends in N&GL.
- Participants will develop insights around how to harness N&GL to support their learning and learners.

Hence I'm thinking the course will be based around a small collection of readings/resources around [appropriate topics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1icZ4qS0__Ma2nL38JicH9EWEy7M9SOQSAZc40W0ytlg/edit#heading=h.nxtc9lpndni4) in NGL.

In engaging with these the participants will be asked to think about how that applies to their use of NGL as

1. Student - Participants will be asked to transform how their practice as a student in formal education (i.e. this course) through NGL.
    
    The course will require the students to do things like maintain a blog and use it as a reflective journal. Engage in social bookmarking, curation and anything else that helps build their network.
    
2. Learner - i.e. in less formal contexts. Participants will be asked to use NGL to learn something personal
3. Teacher - i.e. how to harness N&GL to support their learning and learners.

The "teacher" task being the focus toward the end of semester as they draw on their experience.

The only traditional type assessment piece might be an essay worth 20/30% of the final mark. Most of the rest will be participation and reflection type activities spread over the semester.

### What's next?

Feel free to add your suggestions. For me it will be about re-engaging with the resources and ideas I've got hidden away in my network.

Not to mention reflecting on how much all of the above indicates that I'm [suffering from this problem](http://us1.campaign-archive2.com/?u=028de8672d5f9a229f15e9edf&id=4ba2ccf765).
