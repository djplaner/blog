I'm building [an initial list of people](https://www.diigo.com/user/djplaner/nglpeople) (some additional folk are listed below) who might be considered "good to follow" for the participants of the course I'm teaching on [Network and Global Learning](http://netgl.wordpress.com/) which potentially covers topics/terms/phrases such as connected learning, open learning, connectivism, PLEs etc.

The intent is that this list (which the participants will also contribute to) will provide some initial pointers for the participants to explore. The only criteria is that they are saying/doing something interesting related to "network learning".

Who do you think should be on the list?

Some additional thoughts (in no particular order): George Siemens, Stephen Downes, Alec Couros, Barry Welmlman, George Veletsianos, Bonnie Stewart, Audrey Watters, Jesse Stommel, Jim Groom, Gardner Campbell, Chris Bigum, Joyce Seitzinger, Clay Shirky, Dave Cormier, Evgeny Morozov......
