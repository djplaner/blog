The following is the next step in thinking about the course I teach. The rough process and background is available [in the first post](/blog2/2014/01/13/evaluating-edc3100-in-2013-step-1/). The first post and [the most recent](/blog2/2014/01/15/analysing-some-course-evaluation-comments/) in this series considered student feedback. This post moves onto to thinking about the course itself, what it covers, and whether that's any good.

In the end this post is perhaps more of a description of the current state of play, some newish requirements and some ad hoc observations. More thinking required.

## Considerations and assumptions

Some of the underpinnings of this analysis includes

- This is only a minor tweaking of the course, not a major revision.
- The workload in this course is too high.
- The course is accredited by a professional body and must meet their requirements, including contributing to the [Australian Professional Standards for Teachers](http://www.teacherstandards.aitsl.edu.au/)
- The course should also follow the [existing course synopsis and learning objectives](http://www.usq.edu.au/course/specification/2014/EDC3100-S1-2014-WEB-TWMBA.html).
- The changes should respond to some of the

## Current structure and content

The aim here is document (and refresh my memory) of the current structure and content of the course. The aim being to identify issues with the current situation in the next section.

The 15 week course is currently divided into four distinct parts

- Module 1 - What and why? (Weeks 1-3)
    
    Tries to encourage the students to look at questions like: What are ICTs? What does ICTs and Pedagogy mean? What does it look like? Why should you use ICTs in your learning and teaching? What might it mean for your practice?
    
    A major focus is on students increasing their use of ICTs for learning, both Uni and professional.
    
    Current weekly themes are:
    
    1. ICTS, PLNs and You
    2. ICTs and Pedagogy: Why and what?
    3. Building your TPACK.
        
        Introduce TPACK/SAMR models and the ICT general capability. Encourage students to start thinking about how they might use ICTs in their teaching.
        
- Module 2 - How do you do it? (Weeks 4, 5 and 8)
    
    Currently the aim is to "make you effective planners of units of work that have effectively integrated ICTs to enhance student learning".
    
    Current weekly themes are:
    
    1. Effective planning - a first step.
    2. Develop your learning plan.
    3. Finishing your UoW.
- Module 3 - Issues and implementation (Weeks 9-11 and 15)
    
    The aim here is to focus explicitly on activities and resources the prepare the students for using ICTs for student learning while on Professional Experience.
    
    Currently weekly themes are:
    
    1. Professional experience expectations and design.
        
        Outline requirements/expectations for Professional Experience and how students may integrate ICTs into their teaching (i.e. a bit more focus on lesson planning and implementation).
        
    2. Digital citizenship.
        
        Revisiting and expanding on the broad topic of digitial citizenship.
        
    3. Interactive white boards
        
        As the title suggests, learning about using IWBs. By this stage, students should know about where they're going for PE and now what type of IWB they have.
        
    4. What happened and what comes next.
        
        This is a combination of reflection on Professional Experience, on the course and thinking about the future of ICTs and learning/teaching at both a personal and broader scales.
        
- Professional experience (Weeks 12-14).
    
    Where the students get to put what they learned into practice.
    

## What's required?

### AITSL standards

The obvious requirements are these standards

- 2.6 - Information and Communication Technology (ICT) - Implement teaching strategies for using ICT to expand curriculum learning opportunities for students.
    
    Demonstrate the ability to use a range of digital resources and tools in ways that enable deep engagement with curriculum and support a range of approaches to learning
    
- 3.4 - Select and use resources - Demonstrate knowledge of a range of resources, including ICT, that engage students in their learning.

Obviously not all of this should be covered in EDC3100, but just doing the copy and paste into the above (a mindless task) has generated the obvious idea that many of the above appear to be based on common technical knowledge for gathering, storing, analysing, manipulating etc information using ICTs. At the same time there is common content around topics such a cybersafety/digital citizenship. A bit of coding using NVIVO might help with this. Identify a the common categories and allow better evaluation of the content of the course and also help with communication to the students.

### Learning objectives

### The competition

[EDUC261: Information and Communication Technologies and Education](https://units.mq.edu.au/2013/unit_offerings/EDUC261/S1%20Day/sections/General%20Information) - Macquarie University

- "..ways in which ICT is changing education...how to successfully select and apply learning technologies to achieve intended learning outcomes; the new literacies that educational technologies create; and appropriate pedagogies for the contemporary global classroom..."
- Learning outcomes - like these better than those for the course I teach.
    1. Perform basic contemporary ICT related tasks use computer software/hardware and the internet (for instance, creating accounts, searching for information, uploading files, posting data)
    2. Describe a range of contemporary ICTs and critically evaluate their potentials for educational purposes
    3. Develop ICT-based learning designs based on appropriate selection and use of contemporary educational technologies
    4. Critically evaluate and justify technology selection and design decisions with reference to current scholarly commentary, research and theory in pedagogy regarding ICTs in educational contexts
    5. Articulate strategies for classroom management that promote inclusive education
    6. Explain in a broad sense how ICTs impact on our social, cultural and educational lives
    7. Model positive attitudes and social behaviours relating to the integration of ICTs within teaching and learning, including effective participation in groupwork processes.
- [Assessment](https://units.mq.edu.au/2013/unit_offerings/EDUC261/S1%20Day/sections/Assessment%20Tasks) is interesting -
    1. Create a wiki page explaining a particular ICT and its potential applications to learning.
    2. design a LAMs sequence and explain the choices.
    3. As a group develop a module of work in Moodle.
    4. In class exam - essay on a topic.
- Content much more focused on learning using "technology x" (e.g. virtual worlds, games) - different approach than EDC3100.

## Misc thoughts on problems, requirements and possible changes

Various thoughts/comments that arose while preparing the above

- The "questions" used as titles for the modules need to improved.
    
    e.g. Module 3's title actually needs to be a question. But the other two need to help the students grasp the point of each module.
    
- Timing of assignment 2 - needs to be due a week later.
- The focus on unit planning in Module 2, rather than perhaps on lots more detail on planning ICT use within lessons.
- The absence of the "explore your own idea" approach from Sem 1, 2013.
- Is the IWB week too specific on IWB? Is there scope for using this very concrete approach to illustrate some broader points?
- Add some discussion of the course evaluations of the course to the orientation week.
- Perhaps the week 5 title/focus needs to be more explicitly focused on learning experiences.
- Week 9 - Professional Experience prep needs to draw more on the experience of 2013 students. Encourage students to start working on Assignment 3 in terms of planning what to ask etc.
- Could the assignment 1 artefact be changed to something helping communicate with parents?
- The idea of ICTs as mindtools.
- The requirement that PSTs have some capacity for data analysis and perhaps link to something [like this](http://www.edudemic.com/3-ways-use-data-classroom/)
- More obvious encouragement for students to develop a portfolio of evidence against the AITSL standards and use this more broadly in the course.
- Reflect more about the potential of resources/ideas [like this](http://npsft.webs.com/documents/Standard%202.6.pdf) linked to the standards, not to mention [the ICT statements for the graduate standards](http://www.teacherstandards.aitsl.edu.au/Static/docs/hotTopics/Teaching_Teachers_for_the_Future_-_Graduate_Teacher_Standards_-_ICT_Statements.pdf)
- Enhance the coverage of basic classroom management topics in Module 3 - link to #4.2
