      content: I'm going to use this for my paper on technology-mediated learning. Thanks
        David. I reciprocate with this Keynote from a conference I recently attended in
        Vancouver. http://youtu.be/kIzA4ItynYw

      content: Glad it could be of use.  And thanks for the link to a video of Gardner's
        recent talk. I've seen it mentioned in the twittersphere and have been meaning
        to go looking for it online.

      content: 'I say ''spot on'' because it matches my personal views (and don''t we
        all like our choices confirmed a bit ...). Not a cynic, at least to my deluded
        self.
    
    
        Interesting point about the "struggle to produce material..." and implied educational
        view to go with it. The ''Con'' Brigade (constructivist, constructionist, connectivist
        ... ) would certainly jump at that, with some good reasons. Producing the material
        is not the problem (anymore), the problem is the quality and accreditation. I
        want to know that the surgeon that cuts me up is not a self-taught Dr Nick Riviera
        ("Hi everybody!") with a bunch of MOOCs under his belt. But then - is this The
        Change?  The One? The cycle of history does not suggest so ...
    
    
        Another thing that strikes me is that just like every crisis, fear or novelty,
        every five of those steps is a commercial opportunity. Want new and shiny? There.
        Not sure what you want? We have it. Want someone to solve your problems and offer
        crying shoulder? No problem. Want someone to make sense for you? There you go.
    
    
        Wonder why we go around in circles?'

      content: 'As for the circles.  Here''s my current thought.
    
    
        We - especially our organisations and their leadership - can''t, or perhaps aren''t
        allowed to, admit that they don''t know the solution. Consequently the organisational
        processes and structures in which they work have to be based on that assumption.  We
        know the solution or the direction we''re going.
    
    
        The problem is that given the type of problems we face and the type of context
        we must solve them in, I don''t think there is any way they can know the solution.  Since
        they don''t they have to rely on those confident and comforting folk who come
        with the answer. i.e. the snake oil salesmen with the technology to sell.
    
    
        @cj13 pointed to <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/429690/why-we-cant-solve-big-problems/"
        rel="nofollow">to this last week</a> - "What can''t we solve big problems?". The
        first paragraph of the concluding section claims<blockquote>It''s not true that
        we can''t solve big problems through technology; we can. We must. But all these
        elements must be present: political leaders and the public must care to solve
        a problem, our institutions must support its solution, it must really be a technological
        problem, and we must understand it. </blockquote>
    
    
        Mmm, must get back to writing that paper.  There''s more here I think.'

      content: 'Good point. However, as long as humans are wrestling with it, arguably
        there is no such thing as solely a technological problem.
    
    
        Admit? "I don''t know ..." is seen as an "electoral gaffe", "weak leadership",
        "lack of vision" etc yet it is a precondition for learning, research and solutions
        of any kind which those very leaders and organisations call for. Don''t get me
        started on performativity, I''m a hammer with nails to look for ;-)
    
    
        Paradox of our times. Look forward to that paper.'

The following bit of pseudo-code is from van Dam (1999) and strongly matches my experience with educational technology, especially within universities.

`for each new technology {    euphoria and hype     struggle to produce material for the new medium     mature judgement     disappointment and cynicism     wait for the next technology that will be the answer }`

Though I must admit that I'm finding it harder not to immediately jump to `disappointment and cynicism`.

And the author - [Andries van Dam](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andries_van_Dam) - has a bit of history with educational technology. Though the `struggle to produce material for the new medium` step does seem to suggest a certain type of perspective of education/teaching.

### Update

And don't forget [Birnbaum's fad life-cycle](/blog2/2009/04/06/birnbaums-fad-cycle-in-higher-education/) and the Gartner Hype Cycle.
