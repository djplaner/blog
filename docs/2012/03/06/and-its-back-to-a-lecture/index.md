      content: 'Certainly wasn''t expecting to see the lecture open to the public. Thanks
        for that. Sounds like it had a stationary mike though, making some sections very
        hard to hear. Do they have roving mikes?
    
    
        I skipped the assessment section so don''t have any real thoughts on its usefulness
        to external students, but the length and pace of the first part was quite good.'

      content: 'Hi David,
    
    
        I can see why you didn''t like the lecture, but don''t sell it short (a radio
        mike might be a requirement next time though).
    
    
        A lecture is one way to put a fair amount of information together in one place,
        a recorded or documented lecture is something a student can refer back to which
        can get them thinking about what occurred again.
    
    
        The comments on slate &amp; chalk, nib pens and calculators struck home with me.
        I still try to get them to think without calculators ;) I try very hard to get
        my students to interact with me in a classroom and am only just learning how to
        implement ICT to do this. Documenting lectures is the first way, a bridge between
        the old and the new. It something I can do even without the class full of computers
        I keep asking for.
    
    
        Reading your blog I can see there may be a use for that too, sadly. I''m not a
        fan of documenting my thoughts, but maybe it''s something my students may benefit
        from. I will however have to review policies at work because I don''t believe
        we are currently allowed to use social media and blogs to connect with students...'

      content: Roving mikes are there. But I'd got it all working too late to waste more
        time to figure out the roving mike.  Next time (if there is one).

      content: 'G''day Peter,
    
    
        In truth, I quite like giving <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/davidj/presentations"
        rel="nofollow">lectures/presentations</a> and when organised, can be quite good
        - even if I do say so myself.
    
    
        However, the context/requirements of the course and the mix of students I need
        to help make the lecture less effective than other methods. e.g a single hour
        that is meant to engage both on-campus and online students in a course where I
        see the real benefit from actively engage in the use of ICTs to enhance L&amp;T.  Not
        to mention the idea that in an age of information abundance that I need to invest
        the time in developing yet another hour of information, rather than helping support
        students in their engagement with all the information out there.  Not to mention
        that I like the on-campus students to interact, with the recording apparatus set
        up in the lecture room, on-campus student interaction doesn''t translate well
        for the online students.....<em>insert more reasons here</em>.
    
    
        In the future, I''ll use the online lecture only occasionally and will try to
        use the roaming mike.
    
    
        In terms of the blog, I find documenting my thoughts beneficial in a number of
        ways.  Originally, it was a way for me to write. The writing helped form and change
        ideas. Then other folk started commenting on posts, which brings in different
        perspectives.
    
    
        And now more recently, it''s looking like it might be a useful tool for sharing
        some of the "why I''m teaching that way" with the students in the course. I think''s
        it important that as a teacher educator I model what I''d like my students to
        be doing. And reflection on their teaching is an important example.
    
    
        How well this applies in other settings is questionable. Would be interesting
        to see what the TAFE position is.  I know Ed Queensland frown on social connections
        with students via social media. I believe there is some space for using some small
        parts of social media for connections directly related to teaching and learning.  I
        could be wrong.

      content: 'Hi David,
    
    
        Even in TAFE, it is policy that we do not use social media with students, despite
        the fact that our students are adults. Only in the past couple of years have they
        allowed access to these sites on our work servers.
    
    
        Many useful multimedia platforms such as YouTube were also blocked in the past,
        and this may still be an issue for EQ staff in schools.
    
    
        When I started my degree with USQ I had several discussions with the big wigs
        about access to some sites and had some success because I could put forward a
        fair case for both teaching and learning. Wimba, however, is still inaccessible
        through the TAFE network.
    
    
        I guess in some ways education is a lot like religion in that there are many areas
        where the whole industry needs to advance into the 21st century.

For a variety of reasons I returned to giving a lecture today. Here's a quick reflection and thoughts where I might go next.

### Why?

As originally [explained here](/blog2/2012/02/10/how-to-replace-the-lecture/) I wanted to move away from the idea of a lecture. And I [have implemented the ramble idea](/blog2/2012/02/19/designing-the-weekly-ramble/) and used it as a basis for lectures/tutorials last week.

However, the pull of the lecture is great. So, I gave into temptation and gave a lecture. Sitting here now, I am wondering why I did this to myself and the students. The first part of the lecture was your typical diatribe and done badly. Little or no engagement from the students and achieved little more than consuming some time.

I did get to use the lecture capture facility on-campus, which seemed to work okay. Of course, given the latter part of the lecture was focused on students doing individual or group work, I'm not sure the recording approach works well. I probably should cut bits out of the video. Though it does appear that the quality of the recording is quite low.

As to deciding what I'll do next week, am going to wait for feedback from students, but current preference would be not to record a lecture like this again, focus on students doing activities based on the ramble.

Especially when some of the activities done in the subsequent tutorial generated much more engagement and took things in really interesting ways.

### The lecture
