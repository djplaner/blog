The intent is that each [REACT](/blog2/research/reflection-evaluation-and-collaboration-in-teaching/) paper will follow a fixed format. The idea is to make it easier for people to write the paper by having a pre-defined structure that provides specific guidelines about what information is required. A consistent format should also make it easier for readers to compare and contrast approaches.

A REACT paper is meant to describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a specific intervention into a course. That intervention can be small or large. But it must be designed using the REACT process. Part of the paper is written **before** the intervention.

The structure of the paper consists of the following 8 sections:

1. **Abstract** \- Standard abstract that summarises the paper

3. **Context** - Describes the context of the course. e.g. the discipline, year level, mode of delivery, number of students, type of students etc.
4. **The problem** - Describes the problem the intervention is seeking to address. Possibly include some historical information about things tried within the course.
5. **Desires** - Identifies characteristics of a solution. That is not to discuss a solution but identify the measures by which you might evaluate possible solutions.

7. **Possible approaches** - Performs a comparison of as many possible solutions to this problem. The appropriate literature should be drawn upon to supporting this comparison. It should end with the justification of the chosen solution.
8. **Implementation Plan** - Specifies the chosen solution and details how it will be implemented and evaluated.
9. **Experience** - This section is written after implementation and describes the experience implementing the solution, highlights anything that changed and presents the results of the evaluation.

11. **Conclusions** - Draws some final conclusions and identifies future steps.

Having a fixed paper structure provides two benefits:

1. Act as a scaffolding aid to assist early researchers in the writing process.

3. Make it easier to compare and contrast different REACT papers.
