Getting back into Moodle development has reinforced the need to put links to the resources I use in the one place.

### What I'm currently using

These are the resources I tend to be using at the moment.

- [Courses for Moodle development](http://dev.moodle.org/)
- [General developer forum](http://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?f=33)
- [Moodle course unit on Forms](http://dev.moodle.org/mod/resource/view.php?id=49)
- [Submit errata](https://www.packtpub.com/submit_errata/id/329) for the [extension development book](http://www.packtpub.com/moodle-1-9-extension-development/book)

### "Official" Moodle Resources
