      content: No mistake.  I don't actually have an artefact to share, so had to go with
        something close.  <a href="https://vimeo.com/123151043" rel="nofollow">There is
        a video</a> that shows how/why this post was created and how it fits with the
        process for submitting Assignment 1.
