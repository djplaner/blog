title: Initial rationale and ideas for "continuous improvement" of learning and teaching
type: post
template: blog-post.html
---
The following is skewed by my experiences and perspectives and does not represent the full picture. Hopefully everyone sharing their perspectives will broaden the diversity represented in our discussions.

The "homework" consisted of four questions, I've responded (so far) to only two

- Question 1: What does the cap gap 2 description mean to you? In this section I have drawn on the EEP documents to describe how I'm thinking of cap gap 2. I've also talked more about two important, and likely to be misunderstood, terms from cap gap 2
    1. agile methods; and
    2. digital renovation.I see figuring out how we translate these two terms into specific projects as important.
- Question 2: What are the needs or problems that cap gap 2 should address? The problems I've identified are titled
    1. A culture that doesn't value/trust/engage with teachers
    2. Ignorance of and lack of response to the coal face experience of teaching staff - concrete lounges
    3. A focus on retrospective QA, rather than prospective QA
    4. Lack of recognition of the importance of diversity to learning and teaching
    5. Very limited views of knowledge and learning
    6. Limited recognition of the relationship between fluency, usability and usefulness
    7. Not ready for digitally fluent staff
    8. The institution is not digitally fluent
    9. An inappropriate mindset

Sorry for the length, but I've been living and writing about this for 20 years. I have some opinions.

## What is cap gap 2 about?

The official summary is

> Continuously improve USQ capacity to effectively and efficiently develop, manage, and deliver support and services.

Carmel made an important point

> What is not clear is my mind is what ‘support and services’ actually means to our group – it seems terribly broad

What is meant by this?

When reading [this one page summary](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14025788/EEP/EEP%20Handout.pdf) of the 5 strategic elements and the 5 capacity gaps, I came across this phrase

> methodically reducing barriers to learning and teaching (p. 5).

A statement which perhaps focuses on the ultimate aim I see for continuous improvement. If it doesn't reduce barriers to learning and teaching, then any change to "support and services" is pointless.

The same handout also provides this under the heading "Ongoing and continuous improvements to learning and teaching on page 6 (and just before the description of capacity gap 2) - I've added some emphasis to this

> Simpler said than done, continuous improvement requires investment in information and data access and analysis delivered to where it can be used. It also requires a tolerance for experimentation and demonstration of ideas that improve our practice, processes that provide discipline to our experimentation, ways of transitioning knowledge into capacity, and _the design and delivery of support and services that focus on teaching and teachers and their relationships with learning and learners_

I'm not sure we can get a definition that is any narrower than this, without losing something. The focus here is on anything that reduces barriers to learning and teaching by focusing on teaching and teachers and their relationships with learning and learners.

### More than "support and services"

It's important to be aware that we may be looking at more than support and services, the "Detail" section from the one page handout for cap gap 2 says

> There is the need to provide effective services and to create a culture (artefacts, patterns, norms, and behaviours) that continuously reduces the costs and barriers to success.

Bringing the idea of culture into the picture.

An important - and perhaps slightly problematic - addition to the task. Something that is picked up in one of the suggested strategies

> Developing a culture of collaboration, and the absence of dogmatic adherence to particular ideologies and organisational arrangements.

The cap gap 2 section also mentions a number of other terms that I think are worthy of discussion. The following focuses on those that I find interesting.

### Agile methods

The word "agile" is mentioned 20+ times in the EEP. What does it actually mean?

This is important because there is a [history of agilewashing](http://sphereoi.com/studios/agilewashing/). The situation where an organisation takes on a few practices from agile software development methodologies to give the impression of agile development, whilst retaining all the worst aspects of traditional software development.

The [Manifesto for Agile Software Development](http://www.agilemanifesto.org/) (summarised in the image below) was created by early creators of agile software development and summarises what's important to agile development.

[![Agile Manifesto by visualpun.ch, on Flickr](https://farm8.static.flickr.com/7312/8745184787_90842c59e4.jpg "Agile Manifesto by visualpun.ch, on Flickr")](https://www.flickr.com/photos/visualpunch/8745184787/)

These fundamental assumptions of agile software development are incredibly problematic for large IT organisations (especially "Responding to change over following a plan"). It requires significant amounts of internal fortitude and a significant mindshift to truly implement agile development.

The following image gives a useful comparison between an agile approach and a more traditional, heavyweight approach to IT.

### Digital renovation

Peter Albion (@palbion) and I came up with [digital renovator](/blog2/2011/07/31/residents-and-visitors-are-builders-the-forgotten-category/) idea in the comments section of a blog post before I joined USQ. It builds on [Douglas Rushkoff's argument](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/douglas-rushkoff/programming-literacy_b_745126.html) that some form of programming is an important part of digital literacy. It's a case of "Program, or be programmed".

The idea is that [a digital renovator](http://fedwiki.djon.es/view/welcome-visitors/view/digital-renovator) doesn't just accept the digital environment provided to them. Instead a digital renovator will make modifications so that the digital environment better suits their purpose. This is becoming easier and easier as the nature of the technologies better support this.

There have always been teaching staff in universities that do this. Peter's comments on the [original blog post](/blog2/2011/07/31/residents-and-visitors-are-builders-the-forgotten-category/) briefly mention some of what he's done. I've done similar things and occasionally gotten in trouble for it because it goes against institutional policy.

For me the following suggested strategy for cap gap 2

> Developing a culture that reduces the barriers to “digital renovation” and the attendant use, reuse, and creation of derivative works.

means that I would no longer get in trouble. Instead, the institution will have a culture that encourages, enables, values, and learns from the type of digital renovation that folk like Peter and I have always done.

Especially because the "attendant user, reuse, and creation of derivative works" can potentially be interpreted as meaning the renovation of learning materials/open educational resources. When I mean digital renovation I am talking about work I've already done to renovate [the Peoplesoft gradebook](/blog2/2014/10/14/fixing-one-part-of-the-peoplesoft-gradebook/), Moodle ([the BIM module](https://moodle.org/plugins/view.php?plugin=mod_bim) and the [book module](/blog2/2015/02/10/how-to-help-improve-the-moodle-book-module/)), and Study Desk.

I don't think it's possible to underpin just how challenging both the agile development and digital renovation ideas will be for the institution. These are ideas that challenge the fundamental assumptions that underpin much of what ICT services, LSS and LTS do. Not to mention management.

## Problems

The following attempts to pull out some of the problems I've experienced while trying to teach at USQ. The intention here is not to criticise the people working in central support divisions such as ICT services, LTS, LSS etc. I worked in those areas for a number of years. I know how hard and effectively folk in those central support areas work.

### A culture that doesn't value/trust/engage with teachers

In [Beer et al (2014)](/blog2/2014/09/05/three-paths-for-learning-analytics-and-beyond-moving-from-rhetoric-to-reality/) we identified three different paths institutions can take when trying to improve learning and teaching (the paper actually focuses on learning analytics, however, the three paths apply to any change in learning and teaching). They are:

1. Do it to the teaching staff;
2. Do it for the teaching staff; and,
3. Do it with the teaching staff.

The first two paths assume that someone - typically management and support services - know best and develop some change to learning and teaching and do it to/for the teaching staff. The "do it with" path is described as (Beer et al, 2014)

> This path starts by working with teaching academics inside the course or unit ‘black box’ during the term. The idea is to develop an understanding of the lived experience, encompassing all its diversity and difficulty, so as to establish how LA can help contribute within the context. The aim being to fulfil Geoghagen’s (1994) advice to develop an application “well-tuned to the instructional needs” that provides a “major and clearly recognizable benefit or improvement to an important process”. Such applications provide those outside the techologists’ alliance a compelling reason to adopt a new practice. It is through the adoption of new practices that educators can gain new experiences “that enable appropriation of new modes of teaching and learning that enable them to reconsider and restructure their thinking and practice” (Cavallo, 2004). An approach, which (Cavallo, 2004) argues is significantly more effective in changing practice than “merely being told what to do differently” (p. 97). Thus the ‘do it with’ path starts with the current reality of L&T – the right-hand end of Figure 1 – and works back toward the left. (pp. 246-247)

I'm yet to experience a change to learning and teaching at a University that takes the "do it with" approach. From my perspective, the recent development of the integrated study desk is definitely took the "do it to" path and is the worse for it.

### Ignorance of and lack of response to the coal face experience of teaching staff - concrete lounges

A couple of weeks ago the education schools organised for folk from LSS/LTS to run a session on the new integrated study desk. During that session, one of the support staff mentioned something like "for more information go to Clover". The fairly widespread response to this from all of the teaching staff in attendance was, "Where do I find Clover". At which stage the support staff rolled of a list of websites you had to visit and where to click to find Clover. The list started with go to UConnect. A fairly standard response to that suggestion from the teaching staff was, "I never use UConnect".

[This blog post](/blog2/2014/12/31/an-illustration-of-the-difficulty-of-learning-about-network-learning/) (password protected) documents the difficulties involved trying to find help documentation about the integrated study desk. It appears that no-one responsible for these sites quite understands the difficulty involved in finding these resources. Alternatively, they do know, but they can't do anything about it.

This appears to be the major reason for teaching requiring a lot of time working with tools and systems that are as uncomfortable and fit for purpose as [concrete lounges](/blog2/2014/12/18/concrete-lounge/).

For a bit more insight into the experiences of staff at the institution, take a look at [Albion et al (2015)](/blog2/2015/01/06/tpack-as-shared-practice-toward-a-research-agenda/). It documents and reflects upon [the experience](/blog2/2015/01/06/tpack-as-shared-practice-toward-a-research-agenda/#stories) of three teaching staff during 2014.

### An focus on retrospective QA, rather than prospective QA

Biggs (2001) identifies two types of Quality Assurance (QA), these are

1. _retrospective_ QA; and Defined as seeing "QA in terms of accontability, and conforming to externally imposed standards" (p. 221).
2. _prospective_ QA. Defined as seeing "QA as maintaining and enhancing the quality of teaching and learning in the institution" (p. 221).

In my experience, the institution (like most) is almost entirely focused on retrospective QA and pays little or no attention to prospective QA. As Biggs (2001) describes

> Retrospective QA looks back to what has already been done and makes a summative judgment against external standards. The agenda is managerial rather than academic, with accountability as a high priority; procedures are top-down, and bureaucratic. This approach, widely used in the emerging universities in Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom (Liston 1999), is despite the rhetoric not functionally concerned with the quality of teaching and learning, but with quantifying some of the presumed indicators of good teaching and good management, and coming to some kind of cost-benefits decision. (p. 222)

Prospective QA, on the otherhand

> is not concerned with quantifying aspects of the system, but with reviewing how well the whole institution works in achieving its mission, and how it may be improved. (p. 223)

Biggs (2001) then draws on the ideas of the reflective practitioner and the scholarship of teaching to develop three questions that define QA

1. _Quality model_ (QM) - What is the institution's espoused theory of teaching? I have some problems with a whole institution having an espoused theory of teaching. However, to some extent the institution has already done this with the "personalised learning" pillar of its strategic plan.
2. _Quality enhancement_ (QE) - Does practice align with the espoused theory? How can the theory guide the design of teaching?
3. _Quality feasibility_ (QF) - What are the impediments to quality teaching and what can be done to remove them?

The concepts of digital renovation and concrete lounges are related to the apparent absence of quality feasibility.

### Lack of recognition of the importance of diversity to learning and teaching

[Chris Dede](http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=chris_dede) is a Professor of Learning Technologies at Harvard University. He knows a bit about learning with technologies. [This mp3 file (1m:39s)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/14025788/dede.mp3) is an except from a talk he gave. It is my favourite quote re: learning, diversity and instructional technology applications. This talk is also echoed in Dede (2008) and includes the following points (emphasis added)

> Educational research strongly suggests that individual learning is as diverse and as complex as bonding, or certainly as eating. Yet theories of learning and philosophies about _how to use ICT for instruction_ tend to treat learning like sleeping, _as a simple activity relatively invariant across people, subject areas, and educational objectives_. Current, widely used instructional technology applications have less variety in approach than a low-end fast-food restaurant. (p. 58)

For me, the on-going focus of the institution on "the development and maintenance of consistent, high quality, brand" shows an inappropriate borrowing of assumptions from marketing and IT and an ignorance of what educational research tells us about learning. The translation of "consistent" into standard online learning environments for all courses would seem more likely to create a set of McDonalds courses than effective learning.

Beyond that, the focus on "consistent" seems to be in direct contradiction of the idea of "personalised learning".

### Very limited views of knowledge and learning

The literature contains a significant body of work criticising online learning for demonstrating an over-reliance on a teacher-centered/content-oriented conception of learning. A conception of learning that is outmoded and denigrated. The problem is that much of what passes for learning and knowledge about how to effectively teach at USQ (online etc) shows all the hall-marks of these denigrated views.

There are a number of different views of learning and knowledge. For example, Putnam and Borko (2000) use a distributive view of learning and knowledge. Identifying being situated, social and distributed as important aspects of this view of learning and knowledge. [Albion et al (2015)](/blog2/2015/01/06/tpack-as-shared-practice-toward-a-research-agenda/) use this lens to understand what it takes to effectively teach online at USQ.

[This is an attempt](/blog2/2015/01/22/a-proposal-for-fixing-whats-broken-with-ed-tech-support-in-some-universities/) to rethink how teacher use of educational technology would be transformed if it were informed by a distributive view of knowledge and learning.

### Limited recognition of the relationship between fluency, usability and usefulness

The [2014 Horizon Report](http://redarchive.nmc.org/publications/2014-horizon-report-higher-ed) identified the "Low Digital Fluency of Faculty" as the number 1 "significant challenge impeding higher education technology adoption". Much of the recent work (e.g. the EEP plan, the One University Experience Project etc) include a specific focus on building the digital literacy of students and staff. I see this perspective as somewhat limited and problematic.

First, it tends to reinforce the perspective/argument that

> Staff aren't using our information systems, because they aren't digitally fluent

This is a limited view. I'd argue that staff aren't using USQ information systems because

1. staff aren't digitally fluent; No denying that some staff aren't exactly highly skilled in the digital world.
2. the systems aren't all that usable; and A number of the information systems at USQ are simply not usable. Even someone as digitally fluent as I have problems with many of our systems.
    
    For example, I don't use UConnect (in part) because the single sign-on process is so buggy that I often can't login with my browser of choice (and most of the functionality I get via other means).
    
3. the system aren't all that useful. There's a vast amount of literature that suggests perceived usefulness is the biggest predictor of whether an information system will be used. For example, Motaghian et al (2013) in talking about “web-based learning systems” (LMS) conclude that
    
    > perceived usefulness was the most important influential factor on instructors’ intention and their actual use of the systems (adoption) (p. 167)
    
    Sadly, many USQ systems aren't that useful. Even when they are easy to use, they provide functionality that is simply not useful.For example, the spreadsheet of students in a course provided by Peoplesoft. Fairly easy to use, but it doesn't provide the type of information a teacher is likely to need.
    

It's possible to argue that most of our online courses retain a content-centric approach to learning because Moodle (and other USQ systems) does not provide a usable or useful set of functions that enable teaching staff to transition to a student-centered approach.

### Not ready for digitally fluent staff

[![You want digitally fluent faculty?](images/15025763858_58eea9f20c_m.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/15025763858 "You want digitally fluent faculty? by David Jones, on Flickr")

I am digitally fluent and I can tell you that USQ is not ready for digitally fluent staff.

If any of the projects aimed at developing digital literacy of faculty were success at USQ, the institution would be in a terrible situation because it doesn't provide any of the services and support a digitally fluent person would desire.

This is in part because...

### The institution is not digitally fluent

The following quote is taken from an EEP handout and talks about Digital and Information Fluency

> It is becoming increasingly difficult to talk about learning and teaching without talking about information and communication technology, information services, and digital media. Our ability to turn the opportunities presented through adaptable technologies and digital renovation requires an understanding of the liberating and fluid nature of creation and adaption in digital life, which is built on attaining digital and information fluencies in our learners, teachers, and professional staff that is reinforced by a culture of practice

The policies, procedures, and systems at USQ are not digitally fluent.

### An inappropriate mindset

In [Jones and Clark (2014)](/blog2/2014/09/21/breaking-bad-to-bridge-the-realityrhetoric-chasm/) we argue that the huge chasm between the pitiful reality of university e-learning and the rhetoric espoused by institutions is due to university e-learning being based entirely on the wrong mindset. It identifies two examples of where this chasm has been bridged and suggests that was possible because a different mindset was used. The following table summarises the two mindsets (frameworks).

The argument is that university e-learning needs more thinking in line with the BAD framework. The BAD framework has direct connections some of the concepts above. For example, digital renovation is a practice that leverages the _A_ffordances of digital technologies to engage in _B_ricolage. Agile development is based on the assumption of the world as _D_istributed and supports a form of _B_ricolage.

Table 1: The BAD and SET frameworks for e-learning implementation
|   **Question**   |   **SET**   |   **BAD**   |
| --- | --- | --- |
|   What work gets done?   |   **S**trategy - following a global plan intended to achieve a pre-identified desired future state.   |   **B**ricolage - local piecemeal action responding to emerging contingencies.   |
|   How ICT is perceived?   |   **E**stablished - ICT is a hard technology and cannot be changed. People and their practices must be modified to fit the fixed functionality of the technology.    |   **A**ffordances - ICT is a soft technology that can be modified to meet the needs of its users, their context, and what they would like to achieve.   |
|   How you see the world?   |   **T**ree-like - the world is relatively stable and predictable. It can be understood through logical decomposition into a hierarchy of distinct black boxes.   |   **D**istributed - the world is complex, dynamic, and consists of interdependent assemblages of diverse actors (human and not) connected via complex networks.   |
