title: '"Designing a Secondary Computing curriuclum &#038; pedagogy course"'
type: post
template: blog-post.html
---
A colleague and I have been tasked with the design of [EDS4406 Secondary Computing Curriculum and Pedagogy](http://www.usq.edu.au/course/specification/2015/EDS4406-S2-2015-WEB-TWMBA.html). It's one of a suite of discpiline specific courses being designed to be taken be pre-service teachers preparing to teach those disciplines at a high school level. The following outlines some initial ideas for the course design.

The course is likely to have small numbers.

The following is all some initial thinking, open to critique and revision. In fact, the aim of this post is for others likely to be in the course team (and those working on other related courses) to offer such critique.

The main sections are

- Aim of the course;
- How will the course work?
- One plan for development

## Aim

Beyond the aims outlined in the course specification, it appears a good thing for the course to really be focused on helping learners: further develop their identity as a secondary computing teacher; form productive connections into networks associated with secondary computer; engage with the discipline and its operation and challenges; and, develop practices and resources that they will continue to use as they start work as secondary computing teachers.

i.e. get them beyond thinking of themselves as students studying a University course and more as secondary computing teachers. The pedagogy, assessment and activities in the course should reinforce this. The resources and practices associated with the course should aim to be something that they will continue to use (and perhaps contribute to) post graduation. But rather than being a "destination" itself, the course resources and practices should (as much as possible) be integrated into existing networks associated with teaching secondary computing.

This should also apply as much as possible to the resources and practices used to develop the course. Practice what we preach.

The course also need to fulfill the requirements outlined in the course specification and the various requirements of the relevant accrediting agencies etc. Including the increasingly prevalent requirement of "recency of practice" for the people "teaching" into the course. (I wonder how much the design of the course can challenge the notion of what "teaching" into this course actually means).

## How will the course work?

Aspects of this - not surprisingly - are influenced by the design of the other course I teach (EDC3100).

No lectures. No textbook to purchase. That said, there does appear to [be a potentially appropriate textbook](http://books.google.com.au/books?id=dcCGhyk0O9EC) (thought at [least one review](http://www.amazon.com/review/R2D6T51ETDJI9S/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B000OI122S&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=133140011&store=digital-text) of the prior edition was a little underwhelming). Something to follow up.

A constraint is that there will be 10 weeks of teaching (out of a 13 week semester). Whether or not the course will be organised as weeks, topics or something else will have to be answered later.

The core components of the course will be a collection of "wrappers" or guides. Each wrapper will be largely focused on a particular task. The tasks will be aligned with the course objectives and the related [APSTs](http://www.teacherstandards.aitsl.edu.au/standards/standards/Allstandards). Each wrapper will include:

1. some (minimal) contextual wrapping/context/introduction to the task;
2. a pointer to specific resource(s) to support the task;
3. an activity or three that the student has to complete; and,
    
    Some of which will be assessment tasks.
    
4. a space to collate what current and prior students have done around the tasks.

Initially, the "wrappers" will be hosted on the course site (Moodle). Hopefully this may evolve over time. The wrappers - especially the resources they point to - will be curated via Diigo. i.e. not manually entered into the wrapper, auto-generated from a specific Diigo list.

All participants will be asked to contribute to a Diigo group for the course. Allowing the available resources to change over time.

Each student will be required to create/use their own blog to engage in reflection, discussion, and "submit" their assessment/portfolio tasks.

The assessment is nominally two 50% assignments. But each will be made up of a sub-set of selected tasks from the "wrappers". The tasks are completed on the student's blogs and collated/marked/managed via [BIM](https://docs.moodle.org/28/en/BIM_module).

The primary task for teaching staff will be to model the behaviour we'd like the students to demonstrate. A large part of this will be helping learners make connections with other students, other insights, and external people and resources. This is done by observing student participation (on their blogs, in the activities etc) and intervening as appropriate. Lastly, they'll also need to mark assessment tasks.

## One plan for the development

How to do this, here's an initial list of tasks/observations and the people involved. Each step is expanded below. The roles/abbreviations used below are:

- CE - Course Examiner;
- CM - Course Moderator;
- CW - Course Writer;
- CT - Course Team (all of the above); and,
- OC - folk involved with writing the Other Courses similar to this.

The intent is that the tools (Google Apps, blogs, Diigo, and perhaps Trello) used to teach and learn within the course, will be those that we use to develop the course. This is part of the modelling the practices we hope students will adopt.

For example, here's the [Trello to-do list](https://trello.com/b/IMWGks9L/eds4406-secondary-computing) for the development. I've been wondering how and with what value Trello (or similar) might be leveraged as a tool to help students with task management.

Current identified tasks/aims and people (all very tentative - and definitely not necessarily a purely sequential process)

1. Share the foundation (OC)
2. Map the course - elements and approach (CT)
3. Curate related resources (CT - but mostly CW)
4. Curate related resources (CT - but initially CW)
5. Write the wrappers (CW)
6. Implement the course site (CE)

### Share the foundation

There are a range of other courses that share a common set of objectives with this course, but which are focused on other disciplines (e.g. Secondary Science, etc.) Each of these courses are seeking to develop the same objectives, but with discipline specific knowledge. Each course does build on learners' existing generic knowledge (e.g. assessment, use of syllabus documents etc.) it would appear useful to build this shared foundation in way that was visible and could be used by each of the courses.

Especially useful for course writers being brought in for their recency of experience and discipline knowledge; but who are not likely to have great depths of tacit knowledge about the institution and its programs (not to mention those full-time staff who don't have have those great depths of knowledge).

At the very least, this course needs to develop some form of foundation for its course writer.

The [APSTs](http://www.aitsl.edu.au/australian-professional-standards-for-teachers) are the current focus, so perhaps building on those would be a method.

How to develop a method that more than this course can contribute and gain value?

### Map the course

Currently the course is a collection of learning objectives, APSTs, topics, assignments, and a semester broken up into weeks. Each of these need to be explored, evaluated and mapped. What and when will each thing happen? What needs to happen? How much can we change? What can't we change?

All need to be specified to give the CW a map to fill in. A set of tasks to focus upon.

I wonder what "maps" that others have developed.

Always interesting to enter into this important process and identify the (apparent) complete lack of any tools and resources to help. There may well be some somewhere, but knowing where they are..... Of course, sometimes the only thing worse than not having institutionally provided tools and resources to help with a difficult task. Is having an institutionally provided set of tools and resources.

## Curate related resources

Based on the map, personal experience, and simply what you find when you aren't looking start developing a list of resources related to the course and the various elements of the map. Curate these using Diigo and appropriate tags.

I've put this before 'write the wrappers' as getting a broad idea of the resources that are available and their content would seem to be good input for that step.

For example, a quick initial list from this morning

### Write the wrappers

aka "fill in the map" or "insert \*magic happens here\*".

Iterative development. Initial preference would be to do this using web pages hosted by github, but will be dependent on the capabilities of the CT.

### Implement the course site

Much of how this course will work is similar to prior courses I've worked on. The CW is not likely to have a lot of experience setting up sites with Moodle. Would appear logical for me to do this step.
