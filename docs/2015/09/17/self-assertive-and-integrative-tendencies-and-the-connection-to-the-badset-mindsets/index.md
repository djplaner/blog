      content: "So I have the book and I'm confused that Koestler is not mentioned. I\
        \ know he could drift towards the loony at times, but here's a quote form 1968:\n\
        \n<blockquote>This idea of unity-in-diversity can be followed all the way back\
        \ to the Pythagorean 'Harmony of the Spheres',* and the Hippocratics' 'sympathy\
        \ of all things': 'there is one common flow, one common breathing, all things\
        \ are in sympathy'. The doctrine that everything in the universe hangs together,\
        \ partly by mechanical causes, but mainly by hidden affinities (which also account\
        \ for apparent coincidences), provided not only the foundation for sympathetic\
        \ magic, astrology and alchemy; it also runs as a leit-motif through the teachings\
        \ of Taoism and Buddhism, the neo-Platonists, and the philosophers of the early\
        \ Renaissance. It was neatly summed up by (among many others) Pico della Mirandola,\
        \ A.D. 1550:\n\n    Firstly there is the unity in things whereby each thing is\
        \ at one\n    with itself, consists of itself, and coheres with itself. Secondly,\n\
        \    there is the unity whereby one creature is united with the others\n    and\
        \ all parts of the world constitute one world. [35]\n\nIn the terms of the present\
        \ theory, the first half of the above quotation reflects the working of the self-assertive,\
        \ the second of the self-transcending or integrative tendency, on a universal\
        \ level.</blockquote>\n\nThis division is mentioned over multiple books for a\
        \ decade..."

I've just started reading [Capra & Luigi Luisi (2014)](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/life-sciences/genomics-bioinformatics-and-systems-biology/systems-view-life-unifying-vision), in large part because I think that the shift in scientific thinking they apparently describe in the book may have some useful insights for [BAD/SET mindsets](/blog2/2014/09/21/breaking-bad-to-bridge-the-realityrhetoric-chasm/#badset) and trying to understand and improve digital learning.

In the first chapter they propose

> two tendencies - the self-assertive and the integrative - are both essential aspects of all living systems. Neither of them is intrinsically good or bad. What is good, or healthy, is a dynamic balance; what is bad, or unhelathy, is imblance - overemphasis on one tendency and neglect of the other. When we look at our modern industrial culture, we see that we have overemphasized the self-assertive and neglected the integrative tendencies

A perspective that echoes the point [@damoclarky and I made](/blog2/2014/09/21/breaking-bad-to-bridge-the-realityrhetoric-chasm/) in conjunction with digital learning and the BAD/SET mindsets

Capra and Luigi Luisi (2014) then present a table that compare and contrast the two tendencies and their "thinking" and "values". I've split it into two separate

"Thinking" comparison of self-assertive and integrative tendencies (adapted from Capra and Luigi Luisi (2014)
| Self-assertive | Integrative |
| --- | --- |
| rational | intuitive |
| analysis | synthesis |
| reductionist | holistic |
| linear | nonlinear |

"Values" comparison of self-assertive and integrative tendencies (adapted from Capra and Luigi Luisi (2014)
| Self-assertive | Integrative |
| --- | --- |
| expansion | conservation |
| competition | cooperation |
| quantity | quality |
| domination | partnership |

They go onto suggest that

- self-assertive values are generally associated with men
- the self-assertive tendency is most effectively implemented within hierarchy
- the integrative tendency aims more towards empowering others
- best achieved within a network, rather than a hierarchy
