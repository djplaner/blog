      content: "hi David,\nI think this is a really important point. I've experienced\
        \ this a few times and consequently pushed (successfully) at my last gig to ensure\
        \ we branded Moodle as Moodle \u2013 and now at my current place to have Canvas\
        \ as Canvas. The 'Googleability' of the product is really important. The other\
        \ key factor IMO is the wasted cycles spent thinking about and debating the name.\
        \ One never imagines branding/renaming other major software we use. It's an awful\
        \ throwback to our intranets and 'portals' - perhaps indicative of the tendency\
        \ in many institutions to view the LMS as a content repository ;)\nDoes it hurt\
        \ learning? Perhaps. It certainly wastes a stack of time and effort for staff\
        \ and students alike.\nMyles"

The LMS used by my institution is Moodle, but the institution has "branded" it as "Study Desk". Meaning students and teachers talk about finding X on the "Study Desk". They don't talk about finding X on Moodle. The following suggests that this branding of the LMS may actually hurt learning.

_Update:_ Via twitter @georgekroner mentioned [his post](http://edutechnica.com/2013/11/01/naming-your-lms/) that has some stats on what institutions are branding their LMS.

### Google the name (information literacy?)

[![](images/tech_support_cheat_sheet.png)](http://xkcd.com/627/)

The biggest course I teach is aimed at helping pre-service teachers develop knowledge and skills around using digital technology to enhance and transform their students' learning. Early on in the course a primary goal is to help the students develop the skill/literacy to solve their own digital technology problems. The idea is that we can't train them on all the technologies they might come across (give them fish), we can only help them learn new technologies and solve their own problems (teach them how to fish).

A key part of that process is the ["Tech support cheat sheet" from XKCD](http://xkcd.com/627/). A cheat sheet that summarises what "computer experts" tend to do. One of the key steps is

> Google the name of the program plus a few words related to what you want to do. Follow any instructions.

How do you "Google the name of the program" if the institution has branded the LMS?

Does branding the LMS mean that students and teachers don't know "the name of the program"?

Does this prevent them from following the tech cheat sheet?

What impact does this have on their learning?

### A brief investigation

Early in the year I was noticing that a few students were having problems with "Google the name", so I set an option activity that asked them to create a "technology record". i.e. a record the names of all the technology that they are using. The idea is that having a record of the technology names can help solving problems. I included in that "technology record" that they specify the name of the software that provides the "Study Desk".

There were 40 (out of ~300) responses including

- 10 that identified uconnect, the institutional portal;
- 8 that weren't sure;
- 8 that didn't provide an answer for the Study Desk question;
- 4 that identified their web browser;
- 4 that firmly identified Moodle;
- 3 that identified Moodle but weren't sure;
- 2 answered with the URL - http://usqstudydesk.usq.edu.au;

20% of the respondents were able to identify Moodle.

These are 3rd year students. Almost all will have completed at least 16 courses using Moodle. These are students completing an optional activity indicating perhaps a slightly greater motivation to do well/learn. A quick reveal that most of the students have a GPA above 5.

The still don't know the name of the LMS.

I wonder how many teaching staff know the name of the LMS?

### Does this hurt learning?

Perhaps if everything works with the LMS then this doesn't create any problem. But if the students wish to engage with social and information networks beyond the institution, they don't know the common name for the object they want to talk about. That has to hurt learning.

I imagine that there are librarians and others who can point to research identifying the inability to know the correct search term hurts search.

What do you think? Does branding the LMS hurt learning?
