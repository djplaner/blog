      content: 'I am on of your EDC3100 students and I would just like to comment on the
        Prezi aspect. When providing creating a Prezi there was an option to present online
        and here I assume is the part where the links are not working. This presentation
        option provides a link but also comes with this following statement which explains
        the difficulty that has arisen.
    
    
        "Invited audience will follow you as you navigate and present.
    
        This link expires 10 minutes after you close the presentation.
    
        A maximum of 30 users can view together your Prezi." There is also a start presentation
        button.'

      content: G'day Rachel,  Thanks for pointing one of the possible sources of the problem.
        Most tools have something like this. One of the drawbacks of allowing student
        choice is that each one is a little different and each has their own little wrinkle
        which creates a problem. One question is how to minimise the impact of this without
        impacting creativity and choice. David.

      content: The problem is most students are scared of technology, the current university
        generation has not been immersed in technology, like the primary school children
        we are expected to teach. Students struggle enough with moodle studydesk and the
        numerous ways they are presented in different courses. The problem is partially
        the attitude, possibly these students struggling need a crash course in computing
        where students have success the attitude may change. I was fortunate enough to
        be exposed to technology and picked up things quickly and can now see how the
        simple skills are often interchangeable with the technology used. To me it is
        logic, to another it is bazaar as they don't understand.

      content: 'Thanks for the comment Rachel.  Reminds me of some of the issues. But
        I wonder about the effects of immersion. Wondering whether it''s enough? For example,
        I believe a large proportion of the current crop of students have been immersed
        in Facebook. If we used only Facebook I imagine this collection of students going
        great guns. But with Moodle, blogs, Diigo etc we''re taking them out of their
        immersion zone.  Hence the problems.
    
    
        Will the next generation who have been immersed, still have the same problem?
        Will they only be "natives" in their own digital "country" and struggle if we
        take them outside it?
    
    
        I suppose time and/or research might tell.'

      content: That is so true David, but you also have to remember we are aiming at teaching
        students life long learning. I feel this should (if done correctly) will impact
        students ability to perform out of their comfort zone.

The following is just a "diary entry" recording a bit more evidence for the story that our students are [neither digital natives nor digitally literate](/blog2/2013/03/13/many-of-our-students-are-neither-digital-natives-nor-digitally-literate/). It may or may not become useful in future research/writing. It's not meant to be insightful, just a record of an experience.

The context is marking of assignment 1 for EDC3100. 300 odd students have created online artefacts via their choice of online tool. Youtube videos, Wix/Weebly/Wordpress websites, Sliderocket and Prezi are the most common I've seen so far. There have been some really good ones and some not so good ones. But there's also been some evidence to suggest limits on the student's technical knowledge.

Most of the problems appear to revolve around the idea of providing a URL to a post on the student's blog that includes a URL to the online artefact. The double link caused some problems, but also has the idea of providing a URL. Some examples from tonight

1. Rather than provide a URL for the post, students are providing the URL for their blog.
2. A small number of students is providing a URL to their blog, which doesn't have any posts with links to their online artefact.
3. Prezi URLs.
    
    Been a small trend with Prezi URLs not working. It appears that the students are providing a "long URL" generated from something they see. I'm assuming copying from the browser. This URL doesn't work for anyone but them. If we cut away some extraneous material, we get to a URL that works.
    
4. Spectacularly wrong URLs.
    
    For example, we've seen URLs like this
    
    > davidjones@edublog.org.com
    
    for blogs that are actually located at
    
    > http://davidjones.edublogs.org
    

As mentioned previously

- These are 3rd year students the majority of whom have some significant online learning experience beyond their own typical use of social media.
- This perhaps says more about the technology and its design and use than the students themselves.
- It raises questions about some of the assumptions underpinning common institutional e-learning practice within universities.
- It raises questions about whether encouraging exploration, creativity and student choice can be viable in a course with 300+ students and limited time and support resources.
    
    i.e. the time I've spent diagnosing and fixing these mistakes has taken time away from engaging with student queries about the course content and assessment.
