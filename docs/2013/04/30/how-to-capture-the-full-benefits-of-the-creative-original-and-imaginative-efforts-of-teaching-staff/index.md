      content: i.e. set up small skunk works. Does not mean the main silliness is left
        to die (pity) but that there is a tiny bit of room to try odd/weird/crazy stuff.
        Oddly enough the history of science tells us that is precisely what most of the
        big breakthroughs derived from, not the silly planned, sci -&gt; tech nonsense
        you can see in the Australian curriculum docs on technology.

        I''ve felt conflicted about the suggestion. But in reality it''s what has to happen.  I''m
        thinking about how the "thread of research" being contemplated in this series
        of posts is more about "enabling the Skunkworks" approach from where I sit.  Need
        to think about this more.'

      content: I can definitely see a mismatch in this statement and the practices that
        most institutions are engaging and resourcing. There is a disjoin from what management
        wants, what teachers/students want and the policies that then get implemented.
        Is it that there is a lack of models available to management to encourage innovation?
        Skunkworks is one that is tried and tested, but are there others? Should innovation
        just be the domain of a single group within an organisation or embedded in it's
        day to day business?

      content: 'Love your questions, Tim.  Very similar to questions I keep asking myself.  I
        have some answers, but I wonder what you think.
    
    
        Can (how would) innovation be embedded into "day to day business"? Can you see
        the roles, structures and even technologies that currently exist allowing this
        to happen?  Or, would the day to day business overwhelm the innovation.  e.g.
        could a IT department that gets hauled over the coals when the LMS is unavailable
        for 20 minutes, engage in innovation?
    
    
        I''m sure Chris'' response - and those in the disruptive innovation literature
        - would be no to most of the above.  The problems involved are essentially why
        the Skunkworks approach seems to be the way to go.
    
    
        I have the vague (and perhaps fatally flawed) view that with a bit of tweaking
        of the roles, structures, technologies and cultures involved with institutional
        e-learning there may be some hope.  In part, based on the view of Universities
        as complex adaptive systems where small changes in initial conditions can create
        big outcomes. But I''m also pessimistic enough to think that the increasingly
        top-down, enterprise approaches being adopted within Universities are treating
        and can only see the institutions as a simple ordered system.  The intertia may
        be too great.
    
    
        So, at the moment I''m only aiming to tweak the system enough to let me do some
        interesting things and document the impacts of these changes and the costs of
        the broader system not changing.
    
    
        Actually, a bit of cross-institutional comparative research could be interesting
        around this.  Interested?'

      content: 'I think looking at the players whose business is to innovate probably
        points to some useful differences, e.g. Apple, Google etc. Some of this is the
        stuff of myth but these folk at least understand you can''t legislate for innovation
        but you can try and create/sustain conditions that help. The silly corporate managerial
        stuff of the ''modern'' oz uni works against this. I think folk who have written
        about this stuff which is strongly reflected in studies of science &amp; technology
        includes folk like: Johnson, S. (2010). Where Good Ideas Come From: A Natural
        History of Innovation. London, England: Allen Lane; Johansson, F. (2006). The
        Medici Effect: What elephants and epidemics can teach us about innovation. Boston:
        Harvard Business School Press; Johansson, F. (2012). The click moment : seizing
        opportunity in an unpredictable world. New York: Portfolio/Penguin.
    
        It might be worth thinking about the conditions at places like MIT that supported
        the skunk works that gave us their version of a MOOC. My sense is that innovative
        stuff gets through despite managerial oversight. Corporate managerialism does
        not reward error/mistakes which is the raw ingredient of innovation. Managers
        would see a long list of failed stuff as reflecting poorly on ''their'' managerial
        prowess. It would be fun/good/illuminating to collect little stories of the little
        red engines that did.'

      content: "Perhaps serendipitously I came across this video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4-ffOzjgok&amp;feature=youtu.be\
        \ from Hybrid Pedagogy journal. Which offered a couple of ideas to this discussion.\n\
        \nThe first responds to some of your concerns Chris, \"Collaboration, though,\
        \ both in teaching and learning, is rarely institutionalized at an administrative\
        \ level.\" This is one of the main effects I see of the \"corporate managerial\
        \ stuff\" - the individualisation of learning and teaching, where all measures\
        \ and structures relate only to the individual. This to me is one of the core\
        \ problems to the top-down approach. There is the possibility for innovation -\
        \ but on such a tiny capacity that it will forever remain a blip. By building\
        \ greater cultural capacity to collaborate we can start to build in the day to\
        \ day innovation - which feeds into second idea - the collective.\n\n\"communities\
        \ are built around a sense of belonging, whereas collectives are built around\
        \ participation. Collectives are \u201Ccontent-neutral platforms\u201D with facilitating\
        \ peer-to-peer learning as their reason for existing (53). According to Thomas\
        \ and Brown, \u201Ccollectives scale in an almost unlimited way\u201D (53), because\
        \ they are built around shared practice and are inherently nodal.\"\n\nThis would\
        \ seem to offer another model to for innovation which would fit your idea of view\
        \ of Universities as complex adaptive systems.\n\nNow we get into the technology\
        \ component. This is where social media and social spaces - blogs, google+ etc\
        \ - can enable the collective. However, when we want to institute  actual technological\
        \ innovations then the exiting IT model wont work. From mine, and your experiences\
        \ by the sounds of it, their priorities are too different/ They need to be risk\
        \ adverse and stable - innovation needs adaption and agility. So perhaps the skunkworks\
        \ component isn't a bunch of academics, but a group of technologist that can enable\
        \ the collective. The two models operating in tandem....\n\nJust ideas at the\
        \ moment, need more rigour and exploration to be honest - so would welcome an\
        \ opportunity to explore further with you. I think gaining across-institutional\
        \ perspective could be really beneficial.\n\nTranscript of that talk is here -\

What's good for research, must surely be good for teaching?

An [article](http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/innovation-needs-creativity-not-control-go8/story-e6frgcjx-1226631616447) on the Australian's higher education page quotes the following advice from [this policy note](http://www.go8.edu.au/__documents/go8-policy-analysis/2013/go8policynote7_investresearchfunding_final.pdf) from the Group of 8 (an obviously non-self-serving document, of course)

> If Australia is to capture the full benefits of the creative, original and imaginative efforts of its researchers, it will always need a means to support the ideas and challenges coming from individuals and small groups, even when these ideas fall outside formal priority setting mechanisms

Having engaged a bit in the formal priority setting mechanisms around institutional e-learning over the last month or so, I was struck by how this perspective could be moved across from research to institutional e-learning.

I don't think anyone could claim that the institutional governance processes around e-learning - especially the LMS - could ever be described as "a means to support the ideas an challenges coming from individuals and small groups".

This is not to suggest there isn't some level of need for these processes to ensure the availability of institutional systems. It is to suggest that if you want "creative, original and imaginative" efforts then the processes need (I would argue) to be able to to support the ideas an challenges coming from individuals and small groups".

For example, as [mentioned previously](/blog2/2013/03/18/bim-why-and-what/) as part of the case for getting BIM installed on the institutional version of Moodle I had to explain why others might use it. It seemed that the governance processes/bodies etc didn't know that there were 30 odd courses this year that were using learning journals of one type or another that might have benefited from BIM. There appears to be a lack of knowledge of the ideas and challenges of teaching staff and students with institutional e-learning systems within the priority setting mechanisms that "govern" them.

The trouble with this type of argument is that it's strange. Perhaps because of the lack of knowledge about the issues and challenges, it's impossible for those responsible to see a problem with the priority setting mechanisms. Or perhaps it's an example of the following.

Or, of course, it's not that big of a deal.
