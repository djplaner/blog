Welcome to my blog (the stream). See the [home page](index.html) for the latest posts and my [memex site](https://djon.es/memex/) (the garden) for more regular happenings (and for [more on the stream/garden metaphor](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)).

!!! warning "Broken content"

    A blog with a lifespan of around 20-years means that quite a bit (technical, content etc) has changed. Some of what you'll find here will be slightly broken. Links won't work, some images and other content (e.g Slideshare presentations, Google video) are no longer available, some content won't be rendered correctly, and other content is simply out-dated...but some of it might be useful.

## Evolution

It started in the late 2000s on Wordpress.com to support teaching and research. In the Mid-2010s the blog migrated to a self-hosted Wordpress blog. Come 2025 and it was time to leave the increasingly heavyweight complexity of Wordpress behind for Markdown and a static site.
