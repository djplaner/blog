!!! warning "Broken content"

    A blog with a lifespan of around 20-years means that quite a bit (technical, content etc) has changed. Some of what you'll find here will be broken. Links won't work, some images and other content (e.g Slideshare presentations, Google video) are no longer available, some content won't be rendered correctly, and other content is simply out-dated.

## The blog's evolution

This blog started in the late 2000s on Wordpress.com. Initially to support teaching and late developing into a way of supporting both teaching and research. Mid-2010 the blog migrated to a self-hosted Wordpress blog. Come 2025 and it was time to leave the increasingly heavyweight complexity of Wordpress behind for Markdown and a static site.
