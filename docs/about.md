Welcome to my blog (the stream). See the [home page](index.html) for the latest posts and my [memex site](https://djon.es/memex/) (the garden) for more regular happenings (and for [more on the stream/garden metaphor](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/)).

!!! warning "Decrepit technology and broken content"

    Over the almost 20-year lifespan of this blog a lot has changed (technical, content, etc.) Meaning some of what's here is broken. Some links, images and other content (e.g Slideshare presentations, Google video) are no longer available. Some content won't be rendered correctly and other content is simply out-dated...but some of it might be useful.

## Evolution

Initially started in the late 2000s on Wordpress.com ([https://davidtjones.wordpress.com](https://davidtjones.wordpress.com)) to support teaching and research. In the Mid-2010s the blog migrated to a self-hosted Wordpress blog ([https://djon.es/blog/]). Come 2025 and it was time to leave the increasingly heavyweight complexity of Wordpress behind for Markdown and a static site ([details](https://djon.es/memex/colophon/version-3-memex-design.html)).
