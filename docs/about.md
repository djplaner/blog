!!! warning "Broken content"

    With a lifespan closing in on 20-years means that quite a bit has changed. Which means some of the blog content will be broken. Links won't work, some images and other content (e.g Slideshare presentations, Google video) are no longer available, and some content won't be rendered correctly.

## The blog's evolution

This blog started in the late 2000s on Wordpress.com. Initially to support teaching and late developing into a key practice supporting both teaching and research. Migrating to a self-hosted Wordpress blog in the mid 2010s. Come 2025 and it was time to leave the increasingly heavyweight complexity of Wordpress behind for Markdown and a static site.
