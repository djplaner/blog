## Welcome

To my blog (the stream). See the [home page](index.html) for the latest posts and my [memex site](https://djon.es/memex/) (the garden) for a more iterative and interconnected collection of what I'm think about and doing. 

!!! warning "Creaking foundations"

    This iteration of my blog started with migrating an almost 20-year old Wordpress blog to a bespoke technology stack. Hence, despite the best of efforts the old girl creaks.
    
    Some links, images and other content (e.g Slideshare presentations, Google videos) are no longer available. Some of the content won't be rendered correctly and other content is simply out-dated...but some of it might be useful.

### For more

For more, see the following

- A more historical and detailed [[about-2/index|About me]].
- An explanation of the [[made-with|technology and thinking]] behind the implementation of this blog.
- A detailed dive into [stream and garden metaphor](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/) that distinguishes between my [blog](https://djon.es/blog/) (the stream) and my [memex site](https://djon.es/memex/) (the garden).

## Evolution

Initially started in the late 2000s on Wordpress.com ([https://davidtjones.wordpress.com](https://davidtjones.wordpress.com)) to support teaching and research. In the Mid-2010s the blog migrated to a self-hosted Wordpress blog ([https://djon.es/blog/]). Come 2025 and it was time to leave the increasingly heavyweight complexity of Wordpress behind for Markdown and a static site ([details](https://djon.es/memex/colophon/version-3-memex-design.html)). 

## For more ancient history

The old blog has remnants from my career in higher education, including:

- [[publications/index|Publications]] - a list of more formal academic publications.
- [[research/index|Research]] - an out of date spiel on research interests.
- [[teaching/index|Teaching]] - detail of past teaching responsibilities.
