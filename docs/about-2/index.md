        This is the second time I have visited your site via a link from Jocene. I am
        delighted that her volunteering post got to me via a CCK08 alert.
    
    
        Congratulations on having such a delightful weblog with such rich diversity. I
        have linked to your site at http://keithlyons.wordpress.com/nourishment/

      content: G'day Sean,  Sorry, but I can't remember where/how I became aware of your
        site or when I linked.  Could be a factor of getting old or a malaise brought
        on by trying to complete the thesis.  Had a quick skim again of your blog and
        much of what you're talking about recently is of interest - constructive alignment
        (and qualms about it), reflection, Dunning-Krueger etc.  Feel free to play.

      content: 'Hi David,
    
        Very interesting to read your blog. I''m in bit of the same situation as you are
        now.
    
        I''m in education for more then 30 years. I have been language teacher in secondary
        ed, a teacher trainer for 12 years, a consultant / trainer / head language department
        for another 10. After that I felt that I lost my touch with '' real '' teaching,
        so I quit and became a language teacher again. No I work in a secondary school
        since 2003. I''m am an e-coach also and the coordinator for international activities.
        See my online resume at: http://jeroenclemensenglish.blogspot.com/
    
        After this long entree: Looking back I can see that after 7 years I''m looking
        for a new challenge. Last year a professor came to me and suggested me to become
        a researcher again and start with a PhD research program.
    
        Now I''m writing a proposal for a grant. If I wil get this grant I will start
        my research in september. I will get a grant for two days a week for 4 years,
        in which I have to write my thesis. The subject of this research will be New Literacy:
        reading comprehension of hypertexts ( something like this). I will continue to
        work at my school for two days a week also. Would like to combine research with
        improving teaching.
    
        Hope you find this an interesting coincidence too and to discuss things with you
        a bit more.'

      content: 'G''day Jeroen,
    
        Found your journey very interesting, especially where you''re currently headed.
        Over the last few years I''ve really enjoyed the advantages that flow from interacting
        from an increasingly diverse collection of people. My current studies are also
        helping to add to that diversity. So, always happy to talk and listen.
    
        Good luck with your PhD studies. It can be a challenge, but is also rewarding.
    
        David.'

Most of my career was in universities. Taking on a range of roles including: teaching Information Technology (programming, operating systems, systems administration, software development); [developing "e-learning" systems](/blog2/research/phd-thesis/); lower-middle management; teaching ICT integration to pre-service teachers; and, now ed/tech designer of sorts.

A [digital renovator](https://djplaner.github.io/memex/sense/computing/digital-renovator/) with a love for kludges and bricolage I've developed a few tools including the [(ancient and out of date) BIM activity module](/blog2/research/bam-blog-aggregation-management/) for Moodle and some [kludges for Blackboard](/blog2/2019/11/28/how-to-share-design-knowledge-in-design-for-digital-learning/) (e.g. the [Card](https://djplaner.github.io/Card-Interface-Tweak/) and [Content](https://djplaner.github.io/Content-Interface-Tweak/) Interfaces) and now Canvas (e.g. [Canvas Collections](https://djplaner.github.io/canvas-collections/)). Work that has led to some insights into how University "e-learning" could be so much better.

In particular, it appears that the dominant techno-rational, analytical approaches ([the SET mindset](/blog2/2014/09/21/breaking-bad-to-bridge-the-realityrhetoric-chasm/#breaking-bad-versus-set-in-your-ways)) to the provision and support of institutional e-learning/technology are not sufficient. I'm interested in how the ideas of tinkering, bricolage, making, and [ateleological design](/blog2/2009/06/05/ateleological-processes-definition-and-weaknesses/) ([the BAD mindset](/blog2/2014/09/21/breaking-bad-to-bridge-the-realityrhetoric-chasm/#breaking-bad-versus-set-in-your-ways)) can be integrated with the dominant SET mindset harnessed to [stretch higher education's iron triangle](/blog2/2023/02/09/gathers-weavers-and-augmenters-three-principles-for-dynamic-and-sustainable-delivery-of-quality-learning-and-teaching/) (i.e. to maximise quality, access, and efficiency)

- Being father to 3 great kids and husband to a lovely and brillant lady.

- [Playing cricket](http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/sets/72157623951812043/).
- Enjoying a drink.

### On the land

For a number of years my family and I have lived out of town on small farms. Much to our delight.

We started with 100 acres at Nankin near Rockhampton. We lived in a [combination hut/caravan](http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/51006659/in/set-1106685/) which was constructed (under construction photos: [1](http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/1581095303/in/set-1106685/), [2](http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/1581092797/in/set-1106685/) by my father-in-law. There was a lovely view from the [front veranda](http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/51001307/in/set-1106685/). Which also provided [some interesting times](http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/1581979970/in/set-1106685/) when it rained a little bit more than normal.

In May 2003 we moved to 240 acres in Struck Oil. One of the advantages of the move was having an [established house](http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/2520015647/in/set-1106685/) with some rather [nice sunsets](http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/2426010677/in/set-1106685/) and [other views](http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/2153021135/in/set-1106685/) (e.g. [the feedlot in the mist](http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/51017339/in/set-1106685/)) and some local wildlife ([spiders](http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/2153068511/in/set-1106685/) and [frogs](http://www.flickr.com/photos/david_jones/2426828336/in/set-1106685/))

In 2011 we moved to Toowoomba and eventually found a 10 acre property on the outskirts that has been home to the horses, cats, and dog.
